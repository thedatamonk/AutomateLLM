  "text": "Pre-requisites\nThis guide assumes you already have a project setup and working with Trigger.dev. If not, head over to our Quick Start guides to get up and running in a few minutes.\n1. Define your Job\nA Job is a collection of Tasks that are run in a specific order. You can think of it as a function that you can run on a schedule, or when an event happens. Jobs are defined by calling the TriggerClient.defineJob function\n//this path might be different depending on your project import { client } from \"@/trigger\"; client.defineJob({ // ... job definition }); \n2. Choose a name and ID\nEach job must have a unique and stable id and name. The id is used to identify the Job in the database, and the name is used to identify the Job in the UI.\nclient.defineJob({ id: \"my-job\", name: \"My Job\", // ... job definition }); \nWe will pass the value of the id property through a slugifier because we use it in URLs in our Dashboard. This means you can use any characters you want, but we recommend using only lowercase letters, numbers and dashes.\n3. Set the current version\nThe version property is used to track changes to your Job. It’s required to be a semantic version string. You can track changes to your Job by incrementing the version number, and we will display in the Dashboard which version each Job Run was created with.\nclient.defineJob({ id: \"my-job\", name: \"My Job\", version: \"1.0.0\", // ... job definition }); \n4. Choose a Trigger\nThe trigger you choose determines how and when a job will run. See our Triggers guide for more information. The Trigger you choose also defines the type of the run payload argument (more in this below)\nclient.defineJob({ id: \"my-job\", name: \"My Job\", version: \"1.0.0\", trigger: eventTrigger({ name: \"my.event\", }), // ... job definition }); \n5. Add integrations (optional)\nIntegrations provide a convienent way to create and run tasks against authenticated APIs inside your Job’s run function. You’ll need to pass them in the integrations option when defining your Job.\nimport { Slack } from \"@trigger.dev/slack\"; const slack = new Slack({ id: \"slack\" }); client.defineJob({ id: \"my-job\", name: \"My Job\", version: \"1.0.0\", trigger: eventTrigger({ name: \"my.event\", }), integrations: { slack }, // ... job definition }); \n6. Implement the run function\nThe run function implements your custom code that will be executed when your Job is run. It’s an async function that takes three arguments:\nThe run payload - The type of the payload argument is determined by the Trigger you choose.\nAn instance of IO, which exposes built-in tasks and allows you to create your own, as well as interact with integrations.\nA context object, which contains information about the current run, such as the run ID, the Job ID, and the Job version. Context reference\nimport { Slack } from \"@trigger.dev/slack\"; const slack = new Slack({ id: \"slack\" }); client.defineJob({ id: \"my-job\", name: \"My Job\", version: \"1.0.0\", trigger: eventTrigger({ name: \"my.event\", }), integrations: { slack }, run: async (payload, io, context) => { // ... your code }, }); \nThe run function you define is like a normal JavaScript function in all respects except one: it will be called one or more times to complete a single Job Run.\nThis means that you can’t rely on any state that is not persisted between runs, and you must create tasks to ensure that work is not repeated.\nTasks are so important that we’ve dedicated a whole section to them. See our Tasks guide for more information.\nBuilt in tasks\nWe provide some built-in tasks that you can use in your run function:\nTaskDescriptionTask code\nDelay\tWait for a period of time\tawait io.wait(\"wait\", 60);\t\nLog\tLog a message\tawait io.logger.log(\"Hello\");\t\nSend Event\tSend an event (for eventTrigger)\tawait io.sendEvent(\"my-event\", { name: \"my.event\", payload: { hello: \"world\" } });\t\nBackground fetch\tFetch data from a URL that can take longer that the serverless timeout.\tawait io.backgroundFetch(\"fetch-some-data\", { url: \"https://example.com\" });\t\nFor a full list of built-in Tasks, see the io SDK reference. The below example makes use a few of these built-in tasks:\nimport { Slack } from \"@trigger.dev/slack\"; const slack = new Slack({ id: \"slack\" }); client.defineJob({ id: \"my-job\", name: \"My Job\", version: \"1.0.0\", trigger: eventTrigger({ name: \"my.event\", }), // Optional integration integrations: { slack }, run: async (payload, io, context) => { await io.logger.info(\"Received the my.event event\", { payload }); await io.sendEvent(\"send-event\", { name: \"other.event\", payload: { hello: \"world\" }, }); await io.wait(\"wait for 60 seconds\", 60); await io.backgroundFetch(\"fetch-some-data\", { url: \"https://example.com\", }); }, }); \nCreate your own tasks\nYou can also create your own tasks or use tasks provided by our integration packages. See Creating Tasks for more information. The example below demonstrates creating tasks in 3 different ways:\nimport { Slack } from \"@trigger.dev/slack\"; const slack = new Slack({ id: \"slack\" }); client.defineJob({ id: \"my-job\", name: \"My Job\", version: \"1.0.0\", trigger: eventTrigger({ name: \"my.event\", }), // Optional integration integrations: { slack }, run: async (payload, io, context) => { // Use runTask with the \"get-user\" cacheKey, and return the user const user = await io.runTask(\"get-user\", async () => { return prisma.user.findUniqueOrThrow({ where: { id: payload.id, }, }); }); // Use the Slack integration to create a task using the \"post-message\" cacheKey const message = await io.slack.postMessage(\"post-message\", { channel: process.env.SLACK_CHANNEL_ID, message: `Hello ${user.name}`, }); await io.wait(\"wait for 10 seconds\", 10); // Use the Slack integration's runTask method to add a reaction to the message await io.slack.runTask(\"add-reaction\", async (client) => { // client here is an authenticated instance of the Slack SDK await client.reactions.add({ channel: process.env.SLACK_CHANNEL_ID, name: \"thumbsup\", timestamp: message.ts, }); }); }, }); \n7. Handling errors\nIf your run function throws an error, the Job Run will fail and the error will be displayed in the Dashboard. If you’d like to retry on an error, you can do so using tasks and the retry option.\nconst user = await io.runTask( \"get-user\", async () => { return prisma.user.findUniqueOrThrow({ where: { id: payload.id, }, }); }, { retry: { limit: 3, factor: 2, minTimeoutInMs: 1000, }, } ); \nSee the retry options for more information.\n8. Skip catching internal errors\nWe will throw some errors internally to interrupt run execution so they can be resumed later. If you put a try/catch block in your run code and catch these errors, your job will not work correctly. You can check if an error is an internal error using isTriggerError():\nclient.defineJob({ run: async (payload, io, context) => { try { // Use runTask with the \"get-user\" cacheKey, and return the user const user = await io.runTask(\"get-user\", async () => { return prisma.user.findUniqueOrThrow({ where: { id: payload.id, }, }); }); } catch (error) { if (isTriggerError(error)) throw error; // do something with your error here } }, }); \nAlternatively, you can use the io.try() function:\nclient.defineJob({ run: async (payload, io, context) => { const result = io.try( () => { return io.runTask(\"get-user\", async () => { return prisma.user.findUniqueOrThrow({ where: { id: payload.id, }, }); }); }, async (error) => { //you can return data from the error handler, //if you wish to elegantly deal with errors return { success: false as const, error, }; } ); }, }); \n9. Creating tasks in a loop\nIf you want to create tasks in a loop, you should use for const ... of to ensure that the tasks are created in the correct order.\nclient.defineJob({ run: async (payload, io, context) => { for (const user of payload.users) { await io.runTask(`update-user-${user.id}`, async () => { return prisma.user.update({ where: { id: user.id, }, data: { name: user.name, }, }); }); } }, }); \n10. Return data from your Job\nAnything you return from the run function will be automatically set as the run output and displayed in the Dashboard.\nclient.defineJob({ run: async (payload, io, context) => { return { success: true, message: \"Hello world\", }; }, }); \nNext steps\nWe recommend exploring all of the below sections to fully understand how to create and run Jobs using Trigger.dev.",

  "text": "Welcome to the Trigger.dev Task Library 📚. You may be wondering, what is a Task and why are there a library of them? Well you see, Trigger.dev works by divvying up a long-running job execution into a bunch of little tasks, each one taking less time then a single serverless function execution. 💫\nYou can define and run your own tasks easily using io.runTask(), or you can use one of our Integrations which are tasks for specific APIs, like OpenAI or Stripe.\nWe also have a growing library of built-in tasks that you can use in your Jobs through the io object. These tasks are designed to be generic and reusable, and are a great way to get started with Trigger.dev.\nwait\nThis task allows you to resume executing your job after a certain amount of time has passed:\nawait io.wait(\"⏰\", 60); // wait 60 seconds \nInternally this task is considered a “noop”, and noop tasks have no output.\nreference docs\nwaitForRequest\nYou supply this task with a callback to receive a URL. When a POST request is made to that URL, the JSON body of the request becomes the task output.\nThe example below uses waitForRequest to capture a Screenshot of a website using ScreenshotOne.com and passes the callback URL to the webhook URL to get notified when the screenshot is finished:\nconst result = await io.waitForRequest<ScreenshotResponse>( \"📸\", async (url) => { await fetch(`https://api.screenshotone.com/take`, { method: \"POST\", headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\", }, body: JSON.stringify({ webhook_url: url, // this is the URL that will be called when the screenshot is ready access_key: \"my-access-key\", url: \"https://trigger.dev\", store: \"true\", storage_path: \"my-screeshots\", response_type: \"json\", async: \"true\", storage_return_location: \"true\", }), }); }, { timeoutInSeconds: 300, // wait up to 5 minutes for the screenshot to be ready } ); \nWe actually originally built this task for our Replicate integration, which accepts a callback URL to notify you when a prediction is ready. So this allows you to write very succinct code to create a prediction and wait for it’s results:\nconst sdPrediction = await io.replicate.predictions.createAndAwait(\"🧑‍🎨\", { version: \"ac732df83cea7fff18b8472768c88ad041fa750ff7682a21affe81863cbe77e4\", input: { prompt: \"What is the meaning of life?\", }, }); \nreference docs\nwaitForEvent\nThis task allows you to wait for an event to be sent.

  "markdown": "Welcome to the Trigger.dev Task Library 📚. You may be wondering, what is a Task and why are there a library of them? Well you see, Trigger.dev works by divvying up a long-running job execution into a bunch of little tasks, each one taking less time then a single serverless function execution. 💫\n\nYou can define and run your own tasks easily using [io.runTask()](https://trigger.dev/docs/sdk/io/runtask), or you can use one of our [Integrations](https://trigger.dev/docs/integrations/introduction) which are tasks for specific APIs, like OpenAI or Stripe.\n\nWe also have a growing library of built-in tasks that you can use in your Jobs through the `io` object. These tasks are designed to be generic and reusable, and are a great way to get started with Trigger.dev.\n\n## `wait`\n\nThis task allows you to resume executing your job after a certain amount of time has passed:\n\n```\nawait io.wait(\"⏰\", 60); // wait 60 seconds\n```\n\nInternally this task is considered a “noop”, and noop tasks have no output.\n\n[reference docs](https://trigger.dev/docs/sdk/io/wait)\n\n## `waitForRequest`\n\nYou supply this task with a callback to receive a URL. When a POST request is made to that URL, the JSON body of the request becomes the task output.\n\nThe example below uses `waitForRequest` to capture a Screenshot of a website using [ScreenshotOne.com](https://screenshotone.com/) and passes the callback URL to the webhook URL to get notified when the screenshot is finished:\n\n```\nconst result = await io.waitForRequest<ScreenshotResponse>(\n  \"📸\",\n  async (url) => {\n    await fetch(`https://api.screenshotone.com/take`, {\n      method: \"POST\",\n      headers: {\n        \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\n      },\n      body: JSON.stringify({\n        webhook_url: url, // this is the URL that will be called when the screenshot is ready\n        access_key: \"my-access-key\",\n        url: \"https://trigger.dev\",\n        store: \"true\",\n        storage_path: \"my-screeshots\",\n        response_type: \"json\",\n        async: \"true\",\n        storage_return_location: \"true\",\n      }),\n    });\n  },\n  {\n    timeoutInSeconds: 300, // wait up to 5 minutes for the screenshot to be ready\n  }\n);\n```\n\nWe actually originally built this task for our [Replicate integration](https://trigger.dev/docs/integrations/apis/replicate), which accepts a callback URL to notify you when a prediction is ready. So this allows you to write very succinct code to create a prediction and wait for it’s results:\n\n```\nconst sdPrediction = await io.replicate.predictions.createAndAwait(\"🧑‍🎨\", {\n  version: \"ac732df83cea7fff18b8472768c88ad041fa750ff7682a21affe81863cbe77e4\",\n  input: {\n    prompt: \"What is the meaning of life?\",\n  },\n});\n```\n\n[reference docs](https://trigger.dev/docs/sdk/io/wait-for-request)\n\n## `waitForEvent`\n\nThis task allows you to wait for an event to be sent. To read about how events work, check out the [Events](https://trigger.dev/docs/documentation/concepts/triggers/events) documentation.\n\n```\nconst event = await io.waitForEvent(\n  \"🥂\",\n  {\n    name: \"user.created\",\n    schema: z.object({\n      id: z.string(),\n      createdAt: z.coerce.date(),\n      isAdmin: z.boolean(),\n    }),\n    filter: {\n      isAdmin: [true], // Only wait for events where isAdmin is true\n    },\n  },\n  {\n    timeoutInSeconds: 60 * 60, // Wait for up to an hour\n  }\n);\n```\n\nThe event object returned from this task is the full event object that was sent, including `id`, `name`, `payload`, `context`, and more.\n\n[reference docs](https://trigger.dev/docs/sdk/io/wait-for-event)\n\n## `backgroundFetch`\n\nThis task allows you to perform a `fetch` request in the background, and then resume the execution of your job after the request has completed.\n\n```\nconst body = io.backgroundFetch<MyResponseData>(\"🕸️\", \"https://example.com/api/endpoint\", {\n  method: \"POST\",\n  headers: {\n    \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\n    Authorization: redactString`Bearer ${auth.apiKey}`,\n  },\n  body: JSON.stringify({ foo: \"bar\" }),\n});\n```\n\nThis is useful for when an API is slow to respond and might not finish before your serverless function times out. We created this task to power our [OpenAI integration](https://trigger.dev/docs/integrations/apis/openai), which can sometimes take more than a minute to respond:\n\n```\n// This uses backgroundFetch under the hood\nawait io.openai.chat.completions.backgroundCreate(\"💬\", {\n  model: \"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n  messages: [\n    {\n      role: \"user\",\n      content: \"Create a good programming joke about background jobs\",\n    },\n  ],\n});\n```\n\n[reference docs](https://trigger.dev/docs/sdk/io/backgroundfetch)\n\n## `backgroundPoll`\n\nThis task is similar to `backgroundFetch`, but instead of waiting for a single request to complete, it will poll a URL until it returns a certain value.\n\n```\nconst result = await io.backgroundPoll<{ foo: string }>(\"🔃\", {\n  url: \"https://example.com/api/endpoint\",\n  interval: 10, // every 10 seconds\n  timeout: 300, // stop polling after 5 minutes\n  responseFilter: {\n    // stop polling once this filter matches\n    status: [200],\n    body: {\n      status: [\"SUCCESS\"],\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\n## `logger`\n\nThe logger object allows you to log messages to the Trigger.dev console. This is useful for debugging your jobs, or just to see what’s going on inside your job.\n\n```\nawait io.logger.info(\"This is an info message\");\n```\n\nYou can optionally pass a `context` object to the logger, which will be displayed in the console:\n\n```\nawait io.logger.info(\"This is an info message\", {\n  foo: \"bar\",\n});\n```\n\nWe support the following log levels:\n\n*   `io.logger.debug()`\n*   `io.logger.info()`\n*   `io.logger.warn()`\n*   `io.logger.error()`\n\n[reference docs](https://trigger.dev/docs/sdk/io/logger)\n\n## `store`\n\nThe store object exposes several namespaced **Key-Value Stores** you can access inside of your Jobs. This is useful for storing small amounts of serializable data for later retrieval:\n\n```\n// store some data\nawait io.store.job.set(\"💾\", \"disk-A\", \"Doom 1.2 Demo #3\");\n\n// get it again later\nconst value = await io.store.job.get<string>(\"read-💾\", \"disk-A\");\n```\n\nIf you want to access the store from outside a run (e.g. just from your backend) you should use [client.store](https://trigger.dev/docs/sdk/triggerclient/store) instead.\n\nThe following namespaces are at your disposal:\n\n*   `store.env` to access and store data within the **Environment**\n*   `store.job` to access and store data within the **Job**\n*   `store.run` to access and store data within the **Run**\n\n[reference docs](https://trigger.dev/docs/sdk/io/store)\n\n## `random`\n\nUse this task to generate a random number that stays stable during run retries/resumes:\n\n```\nconst randomNumber = await io.random(\"🎲\", {\n  min: 1,\n  max: 100,\n});\n```\n\n[reference docs](https://trigger.dev/docs/sdk/io/random)\n\n## `sendEvent`\n\nThis task allows you to send an event from inside your job run.\n\nIf you want to send an event from outside a run (e.g. just from your backend) you should use [client.sendEvent()](https://trigger.dev/docs/sdk/triggerclient/instancemethods/sendevent) instead.\n\n```\nawait io.sendEvent(\"🚚\", {\n  id: \"e_1234567890\",\n  name: \"new.user\",\n  payload: {\n    userId: \"u_1234567890\",\n  },\n});\n```\n\n[reference docs](https://trigger.dev/docs/sdk/io/sendevent)\n\n## `sendEvents`\n\nThis task allows you to send multiple events from inside your job run.\n\nIf you want to send multiple events from outside a run (e.g. just from your backend) you should use [client.sendEvents()](https://trigger.dev/docs/sdk/triggerclient/instancemethods/sendevents) instead.\n\n```\nawait io.sendEvents(\"🚚🚚\", [\n  {\n    id: \"e_12345\",\n    name: \"new.user\",\n    payload: {\n      userId: \"u_12345\",\n    },\n  },\n  {\n    id: \"e_67890\",\n    name: \"new.user\",\n    payload: {\n      userId: \"u_67890\",\n    },\n  },\n]);\n```\n\n[reference docs](https://trigger.dev/docs/sdk/io/sendevents)\n\n## `getEvent`\n\nThis task allows you to get an event by ID from inside your job run.\n\nIf you want to get an event from outside a run (e.g. just from your backend) you should use [client.getEvent()](https://trigger.dev/docs/sdk/triggerclient/instancemethods/getevent) instead.\n\n```\nconst event = await io.getEvent(\"📥\", \"e_1234567890\");\n```\n\n[reference docs](https://trigger.dev/docs/sdk/io/getevent)\n\n## `cancelEvent`\n\nIf you send an event that has a delivery date in the future, you can use this task to cancel it.\n\n```\nawait io.sendEvent(\n  \"🚚\",\n  {\n    id: \"e_1234567890\",\n    name: \"new.user\",\n    payload: {\n      userId: \"u_1234567890\",\n    },\n  },\n  {\n    deliverAt: new Date(Date.now() + 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24), // deliver in 24 hours\n  }\n);\n\n// Later on, if you want to cancel the event:\nawait io.cancelEvent(\"🚫\", \"e_1234567890\");\n```\n\n## `createStatus`\n\nComing soon"

This limit is enforced to prevent runaway Jobs from consuming excessive resources.\nWhat is a Task?\nTasks are the fundamental building blocks on which the Trigger.dev service is constructed. You can create and run a task using io.runTask():\nclient.defineJob({ id: \"task-example\", name: \"Task Example\", version: \"1.0.0\", trigger: eventTrigger({ name: \"task.example\" }), run: async (payload, io, ctx) => { const response = await io.runTask(\"task-1\", async (task) => { // Do some work here return { foo: \"bar\" }; }); }, }); \nTasks power the following features as well:\nio.wait()\nio.sendEvent()\nio.backgroundFetch()\nio.logger\nOur integration clients are also built on top of Tasks, so any time you call an integration client method, you are creating a Task. e.g.:\nclient.defineJob({ id: \"send-resend-email\", name: \"Send Resend Email\", version: \"0.1.0\", trigger: eventTrigger({ name: \"send.email\", }), integrations: { resend, }, run: async (payload, io, ctx) => { // This creates a Task await io.resend.sendEmail(\"send-email\", { to: payload.to, subject: payload.subject, text: payload.text, from: \"Trigger.dev <hello@email.trigger.dev>\", }); }, }); \nAnything that shows up as an item on the Run Log is a Task:\nConcurrent Run Executions\nA Run Execution is a single HTTP request from the Trigger.dev server to your endpoint to execute a run. The number of concurrent Run Executions is limited to 10 for Hobby and Team plans.\nThis does not include runs that are waiting for a io.wait() to complete, so you could in theory have 1000s of “In Progress” jobs at a given time with no current run executions.\nGoing over this limit does not abort or cancel runs, but it will prevent new run executions until the number of concurrent executions drops below the limit.\nYou can limit the execution concurrency of a specific job like so:\nclient.defineJob({ id: `test-job-1`, name: `Test Job 1`, version: \"1.0.0\", trigger: eventTrigger({ name: \"test\", }), concurrencyLimit: 5, // Limit this job to 5 concurrent executions }); \nAlternatively, you can limit a group of jobs concurrency limit by defining a concurrency limit and passing it to the defineJobs() method:\nconst concurrencyLimit = client.defineConcurrencyLimit({ id: `test-shared`, limit: 5, // Limit all jobs in this group to 5 concurrent executions }); client.defineJob({ id: `test-job-1`, name: `Test Job 1`, version: \"1.0.0\", trigger: eventTrigger({ name: \"test\", }), concurrencyLimit, }); client.defineJob({ id: `test-job-2`, name: `Test Job 2`, version: \"1.0.0\", trigger: eventTrigger({ name: \"test\", }), concurrencyLimit, }); \nThe two jobs above will share the same concurrency limit, so between them they can only have 5 concurrent executions.\nMaximum Task Duration\nThe Maximum Task Duration is the maximum amount of time a single Task can run for. This limit is partly enforced by the Trigger.dev server, but also by the execution runtime of your deployed serverless function.\nFor example, if you’re deploying to Vercel and using their Node.js Serverless functions, the maximum execution time is anywhere from 1 second to 5 minutes. If you have a single task that can run for longer than your maximum function execution time, it will never complete.\nWe will retry tasks that never complete due to a timeout, but if the task continues to not complete, it will be marked as cancelled and the run will be timed out with an output like the following:\n{ \"message\": \"Function timeout detected in 10s without any task creation. This is unexpected behavior and could lead to an infinite execution error because the run will never finish. This is likely caused by task \\\"initial-long-task\\\" execution exceeding the function timeout\" } \nSee our Next.js section on Deployment for more information on how to configure your function timeout.\nAdditionally, the Trigger.dev enforces a soft-cap of 2 minutes. Tasks that take longer than 2 minutes will be allowed to complete but we cannot guarentee that they won’t be retried erroneously or cause your run execution to be locked for up to 4 hours. This is because of a current limitation of Graphile Worker and our deployment platform.\nMaximum Total Run Execution Duration\nThe Maximum Total Run Execution Duration is the maximum amount of time a single run can execute for. Runs are completed over 1 or more executions, depending on many factors like the number of tasks, the serverless function timeout, task errors and delays. The Trigger.dev measures the total time spent across all run executions and will cancel the run if it exceeds the limit.\nHobby plans have a limit of 15 minutes, Team plans have a limit of 2 hours, and Enterprise plans can set a custom limit.\nYielded Executions per Run\nYou can manually yield a run execution using io.yield(), which will exit the current run execution and schedule a new run execution to continue the run. You do this at most 100 times per run.",

You can create and run a task using [io.runTask()](https://trigger.dev/docs/sdk/io/runtask):\n\n```\nclient.defineJob({\n  id: \"task-example\",\n  name: \"Task Example\",\n  version: \"1.0.0\",\n  trigger: eventTrigger({ name: \"task.example\" }),\n  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {\n    const response = await io.runTask(\"task-1\", async (task) => {\n      // Do some work here\n      return { foo: \"bar\" };\n    });\n  },\n});\n```\n\nTasks power the following features as well:\n\n*   [io.wait()](https://trigger.dev/docs/sdk/io/wait)\n*   [io.sendEvent()](https://trigger.dev/docs/sdk/io/sendevent)\n*   [io.backgroundFetch()](https://trigger.dev/docs/sdk/io/backgroundfetch)\n*   [io.logger](https://trigger.dev/docs/sdk/io/logger)\n\nOur integration clients are also built on top of Tasks, so any time you call an integration client method, you are creating a Task. e.g.:\n\n```\nclient.defineJob({\n  id: \"send-resend-email\",\n  name: \"Send Resend Email\",\n  version: \"0.1.0\",\n  trigger: eventTrigger({\n    name: \"send.email\",\n  }),\n  integrations: {\n    resend,\n  },\n  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {\n    // This creates a Task\n    await io.resend.sendEmail(\"send-email\", {\n      to: payload.to,\n      subject: payload.subject,\n      text: payload.text,\n      from: \"Trigger.dev <hello@email.trigger.dev>\",\n    });\n  },\n});\n```\n\nAnything that shows up as an item on the [Run Log](https://trigger.dev/docs/documentation/guides/viewing-runs#run-page) is a Task:\n\n![Task](https://mintlify.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/trigger/images/task.png)\n\n### Concurrent Run Executions\n\nA Run Execution is a single HTTP request from the Trigger.dev server to your endpoint to execute a run. The number of concurrent Run Executions is limited to 10 for Hobby and Team plans.\n\nThis does not include runs that are waiting for a [io.wait()](https://trigger.dev/docs/sdk/io/wait) to complete, so you could in theory have 1000s of “In Progress” jobs at a given time with no current run executions.\n\nGoing over this limit does not abort or cancel runs, but it will prevent new run executions until the number of concurrent executions drops below the limit.\n\nYou can limit the execution concurrency of a specific job like so:\n\n```\nclient.defineJob({\n  id: `test-job-1`,\n  name: `Test Job 1`,\n  version: \"1.0.0\",\n  trigger: eventTrigger({\n    name: \"test\",\n  }),\n  concurrencyLimit: 5, // Limit this job to 5 concurrent executions\n});\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can limit a group of jobs concurrency limit by defining a concurrency limit and passing it to the `defineJobs()` method:\n\n```\nconst concurrencyLimit = client.defineConcurrencyLimit({\n  id: `test-shared`,\n  limit: 5, // Limit all jobs in this group to 5 concurrent executions\n});\n\nclient.defineJob({\n  id: `test-job-1`,\n  name: `Test Job 1`,\n  version: \"1.0.0\",\n  trigger: eventTrigger({\n    name: \"test\",\n  }),\n  concurrencyLimit,\n});\n\nclient.defineJob({\n  id: `test-job-2`,\n  name: `Test Job 2`,\n  version: \"1.0.0\",\n  trigger: eventTrigger({\n    name: \"test\",\n  }),\n  concurrencyLimit,\n});\n```\n\nThe two jobs above will share the same concurrency limit, so between them they can only have 5 concurrent executions.\n\n### Maximum Task Duration\n\nThe Maximum Task Duration is the maximum amount of time a single Task can run for. This limit is partly enforced by the Trigger.dev server, but also by the execution runtime of your deployed serverless function.\n\nFor example, if you’re deploying to Vercel and using their Node.js Serverless functions, the maximum execution time is anywhere from 1 second to 5 minutes. If you have a single task that can run for longer than your maximum function execution time, it will never complete.\n\nWe will retry tasks that never complete due to a timeout, but if the task continues to not complete, it will be marked as cancelled and the run will be timed out with an output like the following:\n\n```\n{\n  \"message\": \"Function timeout detected in 10s without any task creation. This is unexpected behavior and could lead to an infinite execution error because the run will never finish. This is likely caused by task \\\"initial-long-task\\\" execution exceeding the function timeout\"\n}\n```\n\nSee our Next.js section on [Deployment](https://trigger.dev/docs/documentation/guides/platforms/nextjs#deployment) for more information on how to configure your function timeout.\n\nAdditionally, the Trigger.dev enforces a soft-cap of 2 minutes. Tasks that take longer than 2 minutes will be allowed to complete but we cannot guarentee that they won’t be retried erroneously or cause your run execution to be locked for up to 4 hours. This is because of a current limitation of [Graphile Worker](https://github.com/graphile/worker) and our deployment platform.\n\n### Maximum Total Run Execution Duration\n\nThe Maximum Total Run Execution Duration is the maximum amount of time a single run can execute for. Runs are completed over 1 or more executions, depending on many factors like the number of tasks, the serverless function timeout, task errors and delays. The Trigger.dev measures the total time spent across all run executions and will cancel the run if it exceeds the limit.\n\nHobby plans have a limit of 15 minutes, Team plans have a limit of 2 hours, and Enterprise plans can set a custom limit.\n\n### Yielded Executions per Run\n\nYou can manually yield a run execution using `io.yield()`, which will exit the current run execution and schedule a new run execution to continue the run. You do this at most 100 times per run."

  "text": "Given the following custom event payload:\n{ \"uid\": \"jexAgaeJFJsrGfans1pxqm\", \"type\": \"15 Min Meeting\", \"price\": 0, \"title\": \"15 Min Meeting between Eric Allam and John Doe\", \"length\": 15, \"status\": \"ACCEPTED\", \"endTime\": \"2023-01-25T16:00:00Z\", \"bookingId\": 198052, \"organizer\": { \"id\": 32794, \"name\": \"Eric Allam\", \"email\": \"eric@trigger.dev\", \"language\": { \"locale\": \"en\" }, \"timeZone\": \"Europe/London\" } } \nThe following event filter would match the event:\n{ \"type\": [\"15 Min Meeting\"], \"status\": [\"ACCEPTED\", \"REJECTED\"], \"organizer\": { \"name\": [\"Eric Allam\"] } } \nFor an event pattern to match an event, the event must contain all the field names listed in the event pattern. The field names must also appear in the event with the same nesting structure.\nThe value of each field name in the event pattern must be an array of strings, numbers, or booleans. The event pattern matches the event if the value of the field name in the event is equal to any of the values in the array.\nEffectively, each array is an OR condition, and the entire event pattern is an AND condition.\nSo the above event filter will match because status == \"ACCEPTED\", and it would also match if status == \"REJECTED\".\nString Filters\nString filters are used to match string values within the event payload. You can filter events based on exact string matches, case-insensitive matches, starts-with, ends-with, and more.\nExamples:\nname: [\"John\"]: Triggers the job if the name field in the event payload is exactly “John”.\nname: [{ $startsWith: \"Jo\" }]: Triggers the job if the name field starts with “Jo”.\nname: [{ $endsWith: \"hn\" }]: Triggers the job if the name field ends with “hn”.\nname: [{ $ignoreCaseEquals: \"john\" }] : Triggers the job if the name field is equal to “john” regardless of case.\nExamples\nclient.defineJob({ id: \"notify-hr-new-hires-specific-hobbies\", name: \"Notify HR of New Hires with Specific Hobbies\", version: \"1.0.0\", trigger: eventTrigger({ name: \"employee.hired\", schema: z.object({ name: z.string(), email: z.string(), hobbies: z.array(z.string()), }), filter: { name: [{ $startsWith: \"Jo\" }], // Only trigger for employees whose name starts with \"Jo\" }, }), run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {}, }); \nclient.defineJob({ id: \"notify-hr-new-hires-specific-hobbies\", name: \"Notify HR of New Hires with Specific Hobbies\", version: \"1.0.0\", trigger: eventTrigger({ name: \"employee.hired\", schema: z.object({ name: z.string(), email: z.string(), hobbies: z.array(z.string()), }), filter: { name: [\"John\"], // Only trigger for employees whose name is \"John\" }, }), run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {}, }); \nBoolean Filters\nBoolean filters are used to filter events based on boolean values within the event payload.\nExamples:\npaidPlan: [true]: Triggers the job if the PaidPlan field in the event payload is true.\nisAdmin: [false]: Triggers the job if the isAdmin field in the event payload is false.\nExamples\nclient.defineJob({ id: \"notify-admins-paid-users\", name: \"Notify Admins of New Paid Users\", version: \"1.0.0\", trigger: eventTrigger({ name: \"user.created\", schema: z.object({ name: z.string(), email: z.string(), paidPlan: z.boolean(), isAdmin: z.boolean(), }), filter: { paidPlan: [true], isAdmin: [true], // Only trigger for paid users who are also admins }, }), run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {}, }); \nclient.defineJob({ id: \"send-premium-content\", name: \"Send Premium Content to Subscribed Users\", version: \"1.0.0\", trigger: eventTrigger({ name: \"content.available\", schema: z.object({ userId: z.string(), subscriptionStatus: z.boolean(), }), filter: { subscriptionStatus: [true], // Only trigger for users with an active subscription }, }), run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {}, }); \nNumber Filters\nNumber filters are used to filter events based on numeric values within the event payload. It can also be used to perform numeric comparisons on values within the event payload.\nExamples:\nage [18]: Triggers the job if the age field in the event payload is equal to 18.\nscore: [{ $gt: 90 }] : Triggers the job if the score field is greater than 90.\nscore: [{ $gte: 90 }] : Triggers the job if the score field is greater than or equal to 90.\nscore: [{ $lt: 90 }] : Triggers the job if the score field is less than 90.\nscore: [{ $lte: 90 }] : Triggers the job if the score field is less than or equal to 90.\nage: [{ $gt: 20 }, { $lt: 40 }]: Triggers the job if the age field is greater than 20 and less than 40.\nscore: [{ $between: [90, 110] }]: Triggers the job if the score field is between 90 and 110.\nExamples\nclient.defineJob({ id: \"send-discount-high-scores\", name: \"Send Discount to High Scoring Customers\", version: \"1.0.0\", trigger: eventTrigger({ name: \"customer.score.updated\", schema: z.object({ customerId: z.string(), score: z.number(), }), filter: { score: [{ $gt: 90 }], // Only trigger for customers with a score greater than 90 }, }), run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {}, }); \nclient.defineJob({ id: \"notify-upcoming-birthdays\", name: \"Notify Users of Upcoming Birthdays\", version: \"1.0.0\", trigger: eventTrigger({ name: \"user.birthday\", schema: z.object({ userId: z.string(), age: z.number(), }), filter: { age: [25], // Only trigger for users who are turning 25 }, }), run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {}, }); \nclient.defineJob({ id: \"send-discount-code\", name: \"Send Discount Code\", version: \"1.0.0\", trigger: eventTrigger({ name: \"user.purchase\", schema: z.object({ userId: z.string(), age: z.number(), }), filter: { age: [{ $gt: 18 }, { $lt: 30 }], // Only trigger for users aged between 18 and 30 }, }), run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {}, }); \nclient.defineJob({ id: \"update-user-level\", name: \"Update User Level\", version: \"1.0.0\", trigger: eventTrigger({ name: \"user.scoreUpdated\", schema: z.object({ userId: z.string(), score: z.number(), }), filter: { score: [{ $between: [50, 100] }], // Only trigger for scores between 50 and 100 (inclusive) }, }), run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {}, }); \nArray Filters\nArray filters are used to filter events based on the content of arrays within the event payload.\nExamples:\nhobbies: [{ $includes: \"reading\" }]: Triggers the job if the hobbies array includes the value “reading”.\nExamples\nclient.defineJob({ id: \"recommend-books-avid-readers\", name: \"Recommend Books to Avid Readers\", version: \"1.0.0\", trigger: eventTrigger({ name: \"user.preferences.updated\", schema: z.object({ userId: z.string(), hobbies: z.array(z.string()), }), filter: { hobbies: [{ $includes: \"reading\" }], // Only trigger for users whose hobbies include \"reading\" }, }), run: async (payload, io, ctx) => { //run function }, }); \nExistence Filters\nExistence filters are used to filter events based on the presence or absence of certain keys within the event payload.\nExamples:\nname: [{ $exists: true }] : Triggers the job if the name field exists in the event payload.\nfoo: [{ $exists: false }] : Triggers the job if the foo field does not exist in the event payload.\nExamples\nclient.defineJob({ id: \"send-welcome-email\", name: \"Send Welcome Email\", version: \"1.0.0\", trigger: eventTrigger({ name: \"user.created\", schema: z.object({ userId: z.string(), name: z.string(), email: z.string(), }), filter: { name: [{ $exists: true }], // Only trigger for events where the 'name' field exists }, }), run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {}, }); \nclient.defineJob({ id: \"notify-admin-missing-field\", name: \"Notify Admins of Missing Field\", version: \"1.0.0\", trigger: eventTrigger({ name: \"user.updated\", schema: z.object({ userId: z.string(), isAdmin: z.boolean(), }), filter: { foo: [{ $exists: false }], // Only trigger if the 'foo' field does not exist }, }), run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {}, }); \nCombining Filters\nFilters can be combined to create more complex conditions for triggering jobs.\nExamples:\nname: [\"Alice\"], age: [30] : Triggers the job if the name is “Alice” and the age is 30.\nname: [\"Alice\"], age: [{ $gt: 20 }, { $lt: 40 }] : Triggers the job if the name is “Alice” and the age is between 20 and 40.\nname: [\"Alice\", \"Bob\"] : Triggers the job if the name is either “Alice” or “Bob”.\nname: [\"Alice\", \"Bob\"], age: [30] : Triggers the job if the name is either “Alice” or “Bob” and the age is 30.\nExamples\nclient.defineJob({ id: \"notify-vip-event\", name: \"Notify VIP Customers\", version: \"1.0.0\", trigger: eventTrigger({ name: \"user.registration\", schema: z.object({ userId: z.string(), name: z.string(), age: z.number(), totalPurchases: z.number(), }), filter: { age: [{ $gt: 25 }, { $lt: 60 }], // Trigger for users aged between 25 and 60 totalPurchases: [{ $gte: 3 }], // Trigger for users with 3 or more total purchases }, }), run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {}, }); \nclient.defineJob({ id: \"process-orders\", name: \"Process Orders\", version: \"1.0.0\", trigger: eventTrigger({ name: \"order.placed\", schema: z.object({ orderId: z.string(), customerId: z.string(), region: z.string(), totalAmount: z.number(), }), filter: { region: [\"US\", \"Canada\"], // Trigger for orders from US or Canada totalAmount: [{ $gt: 100 }, { $lt: 1000 }], // Trigger for orders with a total amount between 100 and 1000 }, }), run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {}, }); \nUsing with Stripe triggers\nHere is an example of a Stripe Trigger with an Event Filter:\nclient.defineJob({ id: \"stripe-on-subscription-created\", name: \"Stripe On Subscription Created\", version: \"0.1.0\", trigger: stripe.onCustomerSubscriptionCreated({ filter: { currency: [\"usd\"], }, }), run: async (payload, io, ctx) => { await io.logger.info(\"ctx\", { ctx }); }, }); \nThe job is triggered by the onCustomerSubscriptionCreated event from Stripe. It is configured to trigger only when certain conditions are met. In this case, the job is triggered when a subscription is created with the following condition:\nCurrency: Only subscriptions with the currency “USD” will trigger this job.\nUsing with Supabase triggers\nHere is an example of a Supabase Trigger with an Event Filter:\nclient.defineJob({ id: \"supabase-management-example-objects-storage\", name: \"Supabase Management Example Object Storage\", version: \"0.1.0\", trigger: triggers.onInserted({ schema: \"storage\", table: \"objects\", filter: { record: { bucket_id: [\"example_bucket\"], // Only trigger for objects in the \"example_bucket\" bucket name: [ { $endsWith: \".png\", // Only trigger for objects with a name ending in \".png\" }, ], path_tokens: [ { $includes: \"images\", // Only trigger for objects with a path that includes the token \"images\" }, ], }, }, }), integrations: { openai, supabase, }, run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {}, }); \nThis Listens for insert events in the “objects” table of the “storage” schema.\nConditions for Triggering: \nObject belongs to “example_bucket”.\nObject’s name ends with “.png”.\nObject’s path includes the token “images”.",
  "markdown": "Given the following custom event payload:\n\n```\n{\n  \"uid\": \"jexAgaeJFJsrGfans1pxqm\",\n  \"type\": \"15 Min Meeting\",\n  \"price\": 0,\n  \"title\": \"15 Min Meeting between Eric Allam and John Doe\",\n  \"length\": 15,\n  \"status\": \"ACCEPTED\",\n  \"endTime\": \"2023-01-25T16:00:00Z\",\n  \"bookingId\": 198052,\n  \"organizer\": {\n    \"id\": 32794,\n    \"name\": \"Eric Allam\",\n    \"email\": \"eric@trigger.dev\",\n    \"language\": { \"locale\": \"en\" },\n    \"timeZone\": \"Europe/London\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe following event filter would match the event:\n\n```\n{\n  \"type\": [\"15 Min Meeting\"],\n  \"status\": [\"ACCEPTED\", \"REJECTED\"],\n  \"organizer\": {\n    \"name\": [\"Eric Allam\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFor an event pattern to match an event, the event must contain all the field names listed in the event pattern.

The event pattern matches the event if the value of the field name in the event is equal to any of the values in the array.\n\nEffectively, each array is an OR condition, and the entire event pattern is an AND condition.\n\nSo the above event filter will match because `status == \"ACCEPTED\"`, and it would also match if `status == \"REJECTED\"`.\n\n## String Filters\n\nString filters are used to match string values within the event payload. You can filter events based on exact string matches, case-insensitive matches, starts-with, ends-with, and more.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n*   `name: [\"John\"]`: Triggers the job if the name field in the event payload is exactly “John”.\n*   `name: [{ $startsWith: \"Jo\" }]`: Triggers the job if the name field starts with “Jo”.\n*   `name: [{ $endsWith: \"hn\" }]`: Triggers the job if the name field ends with “hn”.\n*   `name: [{ $ignoreCaseEquals: \"john\" }]` : Triggers the job if the name field is equal to “john” regardless of case.\n\n### Examples\n\n```\nclient.defineJob({\n  id: \"notify-hr-new-hires-specific-hobbies\",\n  name: \"Notify HR of New Hires with Specific Hobbies\",\n  version: \"1.0.0\",\n  trigger: eventTrigger({\n    name: \"employee.hired\",\n    schema: z.object({\n      name: z.string(),\n      email: z.string(),\n      hobbies: z.array(z.string()),\n    }),\n    filter: {\n      name: [{ $startsWith: \"Jo\" }], // Only trigger for employees whose name starts with \"Jo\"\n    },\n  }),\n  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {},\n});\n```\n\n```\nclient.defineJob({\n  id: \"notify-hr-new-hires-specific-hobbies\",\n  name: \"Notify HR of New Hires with Specific Hobbies\",\n  version: \"1.0.0\",\n  trigger: eventTrigger({\n    name: \"employee.hired\",\n    schema: z.object({\n      name: z.string(),\n      email: z.string(),\n      hobbies: z.array(z.string()),\n    }),\n    filter: {\n      name: [\"John\"], // Only trigger for employees whose name is \"John\"\n    },\n  }),\n  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {},\n});\n```\n\n## Boolean Filters\n\nBoolean filters are used to filter events based on boolean values within the event payload.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n*   `paidPlan: [true]`: Triggers the job if the `PaidPlan` field in the event payload is `true`.\n*   `isAdmin: [false]`: Triggers the job if the `isAdmin` field in the event payload is `false`.\n\n### Examples\n\n```\nclient.defineJob({\n  id: \"notify-admins-paid-users\",\n  name: \"Notify Admins of New Paid Users\",\n  version: \"1.0.0\",\n  trigger: eventTrigger({\n    name: \"user.created\",\n    schema: z.object({\n      name: z.string(),\n      email: z.string(),\n      paidPlan: z.boolean(),\n      isAdmin: z.boolean(),\n    }),\n    filter: {\n      paidPlan: [true],\n      isAdmin: [true], // Only trigger for paid users who are also admins\n    },\n  }),\n  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {},\n});\n```\n\n```\nclient.defineJob({\n  id: \"send-premium-content\",\n  name: \"Send Premium Content to Subscribed Users\",\n  version: \"1.0.0\",\n  trigger: eventTrigger({\n    name: \"content.available\",\n    schema: z.object({\n      userId: z.string(),\n      subscriptionStatus: z.boolean(),\n    }),\n    filter: {\n      subscriptionStatus: [true], // Only trigger for users with an active subscription\n    },\n  }),\n  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {},\n});\n```\n\n## Number Filters\n\nNumber filters are used to filter events based on numeric values within the event payload. It can also be used to perform numeric comparisons on values within the event payload.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n*   `age [18]`: Triggers the job if the `age` field in the event payload is equal to `18`.\n*   `score: [{ $gt: 90 }]` : Triggers the job if the score field is greater than `90`.\n*   `score: [{ $gte: 90 }]` : Triggers the job if the score field is greater than or equal to `90`.\n*   `score: [{ $lt: 90 }]` : Triggers the job if the score field is less than `90`.\n*   `score: [{ $lte: 90 }]` : Triggers the job if the score field is less than or equal to `90`.\n*   `age: [{ $gt: 20 }, { $lt: 40 }]`: Triggers the job if the `age` field is greater than 20 and less than 40.\n*   `score: [{ $between: [90, 110] }]`: Triggers the job if the `score` field is between 90 and 110.\n\n### Examples\n\n```\nclient.defineJob({\n  id: \"send-discount-high-scores\",\n  name: \"Send Discount to High Scoring Customers\",\n  version: \"1.0.0\",\n  trigger: eventTrigger({\n    name: \"customer.score.updated\",\n    schema: z.object({\n      customerId: z.string(),\n      score: z.number(),\n    }),\n    filter: {\n      score: [{ $gt: 90 }], // Only trigger for customers with a score greater than 90\n    },\n  }),\n  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {},\n});\n```\n\n```\nclient.defineJob({\n  id: \"notify-upcoming-birthdays\",\n  name: \"Notify Users of Upcoming Birthdays\",\n  version: \"1.0.0\",\n  trigger: eventTrigger({\n    name: \"user.birthday\",\n    schema: z.object({\n      userId: z.string(),\n      age: z.number(),\n    }),\n    filter: {\n      age: [25], // Only trigger for users who are turning 25\n    },\n  }),\n  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {},\n});\n```\n\n```\nclient.defineJob({\n  id: \"send-discount-code\",\n  name: \"Send Discount Code\",\n  version: \"1.0.0\",\n  trigger: eventTrigger({\n    name: \"user.purchase\",\n    schema: z.object({\n      userId: z.string(),\n      age: z.number(),\n    }),\n    filter: {\n      age: [{ $gt: 18 }, { $lt: 30 }], // Only trigger for users aged between 18 and 30\n    },\n  }),\n  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {},\n});\n```\n\n```\nclient.defineJob({\n  id: \"update-user-level\",\n  name: \"Update User Level\",\n  version: \"1.0.0\",\n  trigger: eventTrigger({\n    name: \"user.scoreUpdated\",\n    schema: z.object({\n      userId: z.string(),\n      score: z.number(),\n    }),\n    filter: {\n      score: [{ $between: [50, 100] }], // Only trigger for scores between 50 and 100 (inclusive)\n    },\n  }),\n  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {},\n});\n```\n\n## Array Filters\n\nArray filters are used to filter events based on the content of arrays within the event payload.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n*   `hobbies: [{ $includes: \"reading\" }]`: Triggers the job if the hobbies array includes the value “reading”.\n\n### Examples\n\n```\nclient.defineJob({\n  id: \"recommend-books-avid-readers\",\n  name: \"Recommend Books to Avid Readers\",\n  version: \"1.0.0\",\n  trigger: eventTrigger({\n    name: \"user.preferences.updated\",\n    schema: z.object({\n      userId: z.string(),\n      hobbies: z.array(z.string()),\n    }),\n    filter: {\n      hobbies: [{ $includes: \"reading\" }], // Only trigger for users whose hobbies include \"reading\"\n    },\n  }),\n  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {\n    //run function\n  },\n});\n```\n\n## Existence Filters\n\nExistence filters are used to filter events based on the presence or absence of certain keys within the event payload.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n*   `name: [{ $exists: true }]` : Triggers the job if the `name` field exists in the event payload.\n*   `foo: [{ $exists: false }]` : Triggers the job if the foo field does not exist in the event payload.\n\n### Examples\n\n```\nclient.defineJob({\n  id: \"send-welcome-email\",\n  name: \"Send Welcome Email\",\n  version: \"1.0.0\",\n  trigger: eventTrigger({\n    name: \"user.created\",\n    schema: z.object({\n      userId: z.string(),\n      name: z.string(),\n      email: z.string(),\n    }),\n    filter: {\n      name: [{ $exists: true }], // Only trigger for events where the 'name' field exists\n    },\n  }),\n  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {},\n});\n```\n\n```\nclient.defineJob({\n  id: \"notify-admin-missing-field\",\n  name: \"Notify Admins of Missing Field\",\n  version: \"1.0.0\",\n  trigger: eventTrigger({\n    name: \"user.updated\",\n    schema: z.object({\n      userId: z.string(),\n      isAdmin: z.boolean(),\n    }),\n    filter: {\n      foo: [{ $exists: false }], // Only trigger if the 'foo' field does not exist\n    },\n  }),\n  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {},\n});\n```\n\n## Combining Filters\n\nFilters can be combined to create more complex conditions for triggering jobs.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n*   `name: [\"Alice\"], age: [30]` : Triggers the job if the name is “Alice” and the age is 30.\n*   `name: [\"Alice\"], age: [{ $gt: 20 }, { $lt: 40 }]` : Triggers the job if the name is “Alice” and the age is between 20 and 40.\n*   `name: [\"Alice\", \"Bob\"]` : Triggers the job if the name is either “Alice” or “Bob”.\n*   `name: [\"Alice\", \"Bob\"], age: [30]` : Triggers the job if the name is either “Alice” or “Bob” and the age is 30.\n\n### Examples\n\n```\nclient.defineJob({\n  id: \"notify-vip-event\",\n  name: \"Notify VIP Customers\",\n  version: \"1.0.0\",\n  trigger: eventTrigger({\n    name: \"user.registration\",\n    schema: z.object({\n      userId: z.string(),\n      name: z.string(),\n      age: z.number(),\n      totalPurchases: z.number(),\n    }),\n    filter: {\n      age: [{ $gt: 25 }, { $lt: 60 }], // Trigger for users aged between 25 and 60\n      totalPurchases: [{ $gte: 3 }], // Trigger for users with 3 or more total purchases\n    },\n  }),\n  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {},\n});\n```\n\n```\nclient.defineJob({\n  id: \"process-orders\",\n  name: \"Process Orders\",\n  version: \"1.0.0\",\n  trigger: eventTrigger({\n    name: \"order.placed\",\n    schema: z.object({\n      orderId: z.string(),\n      customerId: z.string(),\n      region: z.string(),\n      totalAmount: z.number(),\n    }),\n    filter: {\n      region: [\"US\", \"Canada\"], // Trigger for orders from US or Canada\n      totalAmount: [{ $gt: 100 }, { $lt: 1000 }], // Trigger for orders with a total amount between 100 and 1000\n    },\n  }),\n  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {},\n});\n```\n\n## Using with Stripe triggers\n\nHere is an example of a Stripe Trigger with an Event Filter:\n\n```\nclient.defineJob({\n  id: \"stripe-on-subscription-created\",\n  name: \"Stripe On Subscription Created\",\n  version: \"0.1.0\",\n  trigger: stripe.onCustomerSubscriptionCreated({\n    filter: {\n      currency: [\"usd\"],\n    },\n  }),\n  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {\n    await io.logger.info(\"ctx\", { ctx });\n  },\n});\n```\n\nThe job is triggered by the `onCustomerSubscriptionCreated` event from Stripe. It is configured to trigger only when certain conditions are met. In this case, the job is triggered when a subscription is created with the following condition:\n\n*   Currency: Only subscriptions with the currency “USD” will trigger this job.\n\n## Using with Supabase triggers\n\nHere is an example of a Supabase Trigger with an Event Filter:\n\n```\nclient.defineJob({\n  id: \"supabase-management-example-objects-storage\",\n  name: \"Supabase Management Example Object Storage\",\n  version: \"0.1.0\",\n  trigger: triggers.onInserted({\n    schema: \"storage\",\n    table: \"objects\",\n    filter: {\n      record: {\n        bucket_id: [\"example_bucket\"], // Only trigger for objects in the \"example_bucket\" bucket\n        name: [\n          {\n            $endsWith: \".png\", // Only trigger for objects with a name ending in \".png\"\n          },\n        ],\n        path_tokens: [\n          {\n            $includes: \"images\", // Only trigger for objects with a path that includes the token \"images\"\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    },\n  }),\n  integrations: {\n    openai,\n    supabase,\n  },\n  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {},\n});\n```\n\n*   This Listens for insert events in the “objects” table of the “storage” schema.\n*   Conditions for Triggering:\n    *   Object belongs to “example\\_bucket”.\n    *   Object’s name ends with “.png”.\n    *   Object’s path includes the token “images”."

  "text": "Intro\nZod is a fantastic utility package by @colinhacks that allows for defining runtime schema validation and type-safety.\nWe use it extensively internally at Trigger.dev.\nBut there are a few places where we ask you to provide us with a Zod schema, for example when defining your own events:\nclient.defineJob({ id: \"new-user\", name: \"New user\", version: \"0.1.0\", //the eventTrigger uses zod to define the schema trigger: eventTrigger({ name: \"user.created\", schema: z.object({ name: z.string(), email: z.string(), paidPlan: z.boolean(), }), }), //this function is run when the custom event is received run: async (payload, io, ctx) => { //do stuff }, }); \nSo it will help to know a little about Zod and how to use it. We definitely recommend the well written Zod README but we’ve included a short primer below.\nBasic Usage\nThere are three main steps to using Zod:\nDefine a schema\nimport { z } from \"zod\"; const mySchema = z.object({ name: z.string(), email: z.string(), paidPlan: z.boolean(), }); \nInfer TypeScript types from the schema\ntype MySchema = z.infer<typeof mySchema>; \nValidate data against the schema\nconst data: unknown = { name: \"Eric\", email: \"eric@trigger.dev\", paidPlan: true, }; const result = mySchema.parse(data); \nWhen using Zod with Trigger.dev, you’ll only really need to do the first step, and by passing it to us (through the schema property of the customEvent function), we’ll do the second and third steps for you.\nDefining Schemas\nPrimitives\nZod schemas are a way to define the shape of an object. They can be as simple as a single type, or as complex as a nested object.\n// Primitives z.string(); z.number(); z.boolean(); z.date(); z.undefined(); z.null(); \nAny schema can be marked as optional, which means the schema can be undefined or null:\nSchemas can also be marked optional by providing a default value:\nconst optionalString = z.string().default(\"default value\"); const value = optionalString.parse(undefined); // value === \"default value\" \nIf you need to allow a value to be null, you can use nullable():\nconst nullableString = z.string().nullable(); const value = nullableString.parse(null); \nYou can also use Zod to coerce primites into other types. For example, you can coerce a string into a number:\nconst numberString = z.coerce.number(); const value = numberString.parse(\"123\"); // value === 123 \nThe following primitives are supported:\nz.coerce.string(); z.coerce.number(); z.coerce.boolean(); z.coerce.bigint(); z.coerce.date(); \nCoercing dates are especially useful when you are receiving a string from an API and want to convert it to a JavaScript Date object:\nconst date = z.coerce.date(); const value = date.parse(\"2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\"); // value === Date object \nObjects\nObject schemas are the most common type of schema. They allow you to define the shape of an object, and the types of each property.\nconst mySchema = z.object({ name: z.string(), email: z.string(), paidPlan: z.boolean(), }); \nAll properties are required by default, although you can make them all optional using partial():\nconst mySchema = z .object({ name: z.string(), email: z.string(), paidPlan: z.boolean(), }) .partial(); \nYou can also make individual properties optional:\nconst mySchema = z.object({ name: z.string(), email: z.string(), paidPlan: z.boolean().optional(), }); \nBy default an object schema will strip out any extra properties that are not defined in the schema. You can disable this behavior using passthrough():\nconst mySchema = z.object({ name: z.string(), }); mySchema.parse({ name: \"Eric\", email: \"eric@trigger.dev\" }); // { name: \"Eric\" } mySchema.passthrough().parse({ name: \"Eric\", email: \"eric@trigger.dev\" }); // { name: \"Eric\", email: \"eric@trigger.dev\" } \nOr you can use strict() to make the schema throw an error if there are any extra properties:\nconst mySchema = z .object({ name: z.string(), }) .strict(); mySchema.parse({ name: \"Eric\", email: \"eric@trigger.dev\" }); // throws error \nZod includes a few useful object schema utilities to help with reusing schemas, extends() and merge():\nconst baseSchema = z.object({ name: z.string(), }); const extendedSchema = baseSchema.extend({ email: z.string(), }); const mergedSchema = baseSchema.merge( z.object({ email: z.string(), }) ); \nYou can also use pick() and omit() to create a new schema that only includes or excludes certain properties:\nconst mySchema = z.object({ name: z.string(), email: z.string(), paidPlan: z.boolean(), }); const pickedSchema = mySchema.pick({ name: true, email: true }); const omittedSchema = mySchema.omit({ paidPlan: true }); \nArrays\nYou can specify the schema of an array using z.array():\nz.array(z.string()); // string[] z.array(z.number()); // number[] z.array(z.object({ name: z.string() })); // Array<{ name: string }> \nYou can also specify the type of array that has a fixed number of elements using z.tuple():\nz.tuple([z.string(), z.number(), z.boolean()]); // [string, number, boolean] \nUnions\nYou can specify a union of schemas using z.union():\nz.union([z.string(), z.number(), z.boolean()]); // string | number | boolean \nDiscriminating unions are also supported, and especially useful when paired with type narrowing:\nconst mySchema = z.discriminatingUnion(\"type\", [ z.object({ type: z.literal(\"a\"), data: z.string(), }), z.object({ type: z.literal(\"b\"), data: z.number(), }), ]); const value = mySchema.parse({ type: \"a\", data: \"hello\" }); if (type.a) { // value is { type: \"a\", data: string } } else if (type.b) { // value is { type: \"b\", data: number } } \nRecords\nYou can specify a record of schemas using z.record(), useful for when you have a map of values but don’t care about the keys:\nz.record(z.string()); // Record<string, string> z.record(z.number()); // Record<string, number> \nJSON type\nIf you want to accept any valid JSON value, you can use the following schema:\nconst literalSchema = z.union([z.string(), z.number(), z.boolean(), z.null()]); type Literal = z.infer<typeof literalSchema>; type Json = Literal | { [key: string]: Json } | Json[]; const jsonSchema: z.ZodType<Json> = z.lazy(() => z.union([literalSchema, z.array(jsonSchema), z.record(jsonSchema)]) ); jsonSchema.parse(data); \nHat tip to ggoodman for this one.\nResources\nMatt Pocock @mattpocock has a great free Zod Tutorial up on Total Typescript that covers the basics of Zod.\nEasily generate Zod schemas from JSON, JSON Schemas, or TypeScript types.",
  "markdown": "## Intro\n\nZod is a fantastic utility package by [@colinhacks](https://twitter.com/colinhacks) that allows for defining runtime schema validation and type-safety.\n\nWe use it [extensively](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Atriggerdotdev%2Ftrigger.dev+%22zod%22%3B&type=code) internally at Trigger.dev.\n\nBut there are a few places where we ask you to provide us with a Zod schema, for example when defining your own [events](https://trigger.dev/docs/documentation/concepts/triggers/events):\n\n```\nclient.defineJob({\n  id: \"new-user\",\n  name: \"New user\",\n  version: \"0.1.0\",\n  //the eventTrigger uses zod to define the schema\n  trigger: eventTrigger({\n    name: \"user.created\",\n    schema: z.object({\n      name: z.string(),\n      email: z.string(),\n      paidPlan: z.boolean(),\n    }),\n  }),\n  //this function is run when the custom event is received\n  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {\n    //do stuff\n  },\n});\n```\n\nSo it will help to know a little about Zod and how to use it. We definitely recommend the well written [Zod README](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod#readme) but we’ve included a short primer below.\n\n## Basic Usage\n\nThere are three main steps to using Zod:\n\n1.  Define a schema\n\n```\nimport { z } from \"zod\";\n\nconst mySchema = z.object({\n  name: z.string(),\n  email: z.string(),\n  paidPlan: z.boolean(),\n});\n```\n\n2.  Infer TypeScript types from the schema\n\n```\ntype MySchema = z.infer<typeof mySchema>;\n```\n\n3.  Validate data against the schema\n\n```\nconst data: unknown = {\n  name: \"Eric\",\n  email: \"eric@trigger.dev\",\n  paidPlan: true,\n};\n\nconst result = mySchema.parse(data);\n```\n\nWhen using Zod with Trigger.dev, you’ll only really need to do the first step, and by passing it to us (through the `schema` property of the `customEvent` function), we’ll do the second and third steps for you.\n\n## Defining Schemas\n\n### Primitives\n\nZod schemas are a way to define the shape of an object. They can be as simple as a single type, or as complex as a nested object.\n\n```\n// Primitives\nz.string();\nz.number();\nz.boolean();\nz.date();\nz.undefined();\nz.null();\n```\n\nAny schema can be marked as optional, which means the schema can be `undefined` or `null`:\n\nSchemas can also be marked optional by providing a default value:\n\n```\nconst optionalString = z.string().default(\"default value\");\n\nconst value = optionalString.parse(undefined); // value === \"default value\"\n```\n\nIf you need to allow a value to be `null`, you can use `nullable()`:\n\n```\nconst nullableString = z.string().nullable();\n\nconst value = nullableString.parse(null);\n```\n\nYou can also use Zod to coerce primites into other types. For example, you can coerce a string into a number:\n\n```\nconst numberString = z.coerce.number();\n\nconst value = numberString.parse(\"123\"); // value === 123\n```\n\nThe following primitives are supported:\n\n```\nz.coerce.string();\nz.coerce.number();\nz.coerce.boolean();\nz.coerce.bigint();\nz.coerce.date();\n```\n\nCoercing dates are especially useful when you are receiving a `string` from an API and want to convert it to a JavaScript `Date` object:\n\n```\nconst date = z.coerce.date();\n\nconst value = date.parse(\"2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\"); // value === Date object\n```\n\n### Objects\n\nObject schemas are the most common type of schema. They allow you to define the shape of an object, and the types of each property.\n\n```\nconst mySchema = z.object({\n  name: z.string(),\n  email: z.string(),\n  paidPlan: z.boolean(),\n});\n```\n\nAll properties are required by default, although you can make them all optional using `partial()`:\n\n```\nconst mySchema = z\n  .object({\n    name: z.string(),\n    email: z.string(),\n    paidPlan: z.boolean(),\n  })\n  .partial();\n```\n\nYou can also make individual properties optional:\n\n```\nconst mySchema = z.object({\n  name: z.string(),\n  email: z.string(),\n  paidPlan: z.boolean().optional(),\n});\n```\n\nBy default an object schema will strip out any extra properties that are not defined in the schema. You can disable this behavior using `passthrough()`:\n\n```\nconst mySchema = z.object({\n  name: z.string(),\n});\n\nmySchema.parse({ name: \"Eric\", email: \"eric@trigger.dev\" }); // { name: \"Eric\" }\nmySchema.passthrough().parse({ name: \"Eric\", email: \"eric@trigger.dev\" }); // { name: \"Eric\", email: \"eric@trigger.dev\" }\n```\n\nOr you can use `strict()` to make the schema throw an error if there are any extra properties:\n\n```\nconst mySchema = z\n  .object({\n    name: z.string(),\n  })\n  .strict();\n\nmySchema.parse({ name: \"Eric\", email: \"eric@trigger.dev\" }); // throws error\n```\n\nZod includes a few useful object schema utilities to help with reusing schemas, `extends()` and `merge()`:\n\n```\nconst baseSchema = z.object({\n  name: z.string(),\n});\n\nconst extendedSchema = baseSchema.extend({\n  email: z.string(),\n});\n\nconst mergedSchema = baseSchema.merge(\n  z.object({\n    email: z.string(),\n  })\n);\n```\n\nYou can also use `pick()` and `omit()` to create a new schema that only includes or excludes certain properties:\n\n```\nconst mySchema = z.object({\n  name: z.string(),\n  email: z.string(),\n  paidPlan: z.boolean(),\n});\n\nconst pickedSchema = mySchema.pick({ name: true, email: true });\nconst omittedSchema = mySchema.omit({ paidPlan: true });\n```\n\n### Arrays\n\nYou can specify the schema of an array using `z.array()`:\n\n```\nz.array(z.string()); // string[]\nz.array(z.number()); // number[]\nz.array(z.object({ name: z.string() })); // Array<{ name: string }>\n```\n\nYou can also specify the type of array that has a fixed number of elements using `z.tuple()`:\n\n```\nz.tuple([z.string(), z.number(), z.boolean()]); // [string, number, boolean]\n```\n\n### Unions\n\nYou can specify a union of schemas using `z.union()`:\n\n```\nz.union([z.string(), z.number(), z.boolean()]); // string | number | boolean\n```\n\nDiscriminating unions are also supported, and especially useful when paired with type narrowing:\n\n```\nconst mySchema = z.discriminatingUnion(\"type\", [\n  z.object({\n    type: z.literal(\"a\"),\n    data: z.string(),\n  }),\n  z.object({\n    type: z.literal(\"b\"),\n    data: z.number(),\n  }),\n]);\n\nconst value = mySchema.parse({ type: \"a\", data: \"hello\" });\n\nif (type.a) {\n  // value is { type: \"a\", data: string }\n} else if (type.b) {\n  // value is { type: \"b\", data: number }\n}\n```\n\n### Records\n\nYou can specify a record of schemas using `z.record()`, useful for when you have a map of values but don’t care about the keys:\n\n```\nz.record(z.string()); // Record<string, string>\nz.record(z.number()); // Record<string, number>\n```\n\n### JSON type\n\nIf you want to accept any valid JSON value, you can use the following schema:\n\n```\nconst literalSchema = z.union([z.string(), z.number(), z.boolean(), z.null()]);\ntype Literal = z.infer<typeof literalSchema>;\ntype Json = Literal | { [key: string]: Json } | Json[];\nconst jsonSchema: z.ZodType<Json> = z.lazy(() =>\n  z.union([literalSchema, z.array(jsonSchema), z.record(jsonSchema)])\n);\n\njsonSchema.parse(data);\n```\n\nHat tip to [ggoodman](https://github.com/ggoodman) for this one.\n\n## Resources\n\nMatt Pocock [@mattpocock](https://twitter.com/mattpocockuk) has a great free Zod Tutorial up on [Total Typescript](https://www.totaltypescript.com/tutorials/zod) that covers the basics of Zod.\n\nEasily generate Zod schemas from [JSON](https://transform.tools/json-to-zod), [JSON Schemas](https://transform.tools/json-schema-to-zod), or [TypeScript](https://transform.tools/typescript-to-zod) types."

  "text": "A Task is a cached unit of work in a Job Run that are logged to the Trigger.dev UI.\nWhy do you need tasks?\nTasks are a key building block of how Trigger.dev works, and failing to use them will result in unpredictable results. Tasks allow bits of work inside a Job Run to be cached and the results of those tasks to be reused.\nThis is very important because for a Job Run to be resumable (e.g. after a serverless function timeout, or because of a call to io.wait()), we need to call the Job.run function multiple times. If we didn’t cache the results of Tasks, then we would be repeating work on each run.\nclient.defineJob({ id: \"new-user\", name: \"Run when a new user signs up\", version: \"1.0.0\", trigger: eventTrigger({ name: \"new.user\", schema: z.object({ userId: z.string(), }), }), integrations: { resend, }, run: async (payload, io, ctx) => { // This code will run twice. Once when the run first starts, and once after the wait const user = await prisma.user.findUniqueOrThrow({ where: { id: payload.userId }, select: { email: true, name: true }, }); // This code will run once, because the resend integration creates a task with the \"welcome-email\" cacheKey await io.resend.sendEmail(\"welcome-email\", { to: user.email, from: \"jane@acme.inc\", subject: \"Welcome!\", html: welcomeEmail(user.name), }); // This code will run once, because io.wait creates a task with the \"wait\" cacheKey await io.wait(\"wait\", 60 * 60 * 3); // wait for 3 hours // This code will run once, because we're manually creating a task with the \"my-task\" cacheKey const response = await io.runTask( \"my-task\", async () => { return await longRunningCode(payload.userId); }, { name: \"My Task\" } ); return response; }, }); \nAs well as powering the resumable nature of Trigger.dev, Tasks also provide:\nRetryable – If a Task fails, it can be retried. You can configure how (or if) a Task is retried. Full details in the io.runTask() SDK reference.\nLogging – Tasks are logged, so you can see what happened in a Run. Find out more about viewing runs.\nTask Cache Keys\nThe first param of all Tasks is a cacheKey. This is a unique identifier for the Task inside that Run. It is used for storing the cached result of a task. It is also used to identify the Task in the Viewing Runs Dashboard.\nCreating Tasks\nThere are 3 ways of using tasks in your code:\nUsing the io.runTask() function\nUsing one of our Integration packages and calling the io.integration.runTask() wrapper\nUsing one of our Integration packages and calling a task wrapper function, such as io.slack.postMessage()\nUsing io.runTask()\nThe io.runTask() function allows you to run a Task manually. It takes a cacheKey and a function to run. The function will only be run if the Task is not already cached.\nconst response = await io.runTask(\"my-task\", async (task) => { return await longRunningCode(payload.userId); }); \nThe callback function is passed a task object, which can be useful for providing an idempotency key to an external service. For example, Stripe:\nconst stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, { apiVersion: \"2020-08-27\", }); await io.runTask(\"create-customer\", async (task) => { await stripe.customers.create( { email: \"eric@trigger.dev\", }, { idempotencyKey: task.idempotencyKey, } ); }); \nrunTask also takes an optional 3rd argument, which allows you to customize how the Task is displayed and run. For example, you can supply a name and some properties to be displayed in the Viewing Runs Dashboard:\nconst response = await io.runTask( \"my-task\", async (task) => { return await longRunningCode(payload.userId); }, { name: \"My Task\", properties: [ { label: \"User ID\", value: payload.userId, }, ], icon: \"user\", } ); \nSee the io.runTask() SDK reference for more information.\nUsing io.integration.runTask()\nAll of our Integration packages expose a runTask() function. The main differences between this and io.runTask() are:\nAdds an additional callback parameter which provides the underlying authenticated integration client\nAutomatically sets the icon property on the Task.\nConfigures sensible defaults for retries and error handling.\nAn example here demonstrates using the GitHub integration’s runTask function to create a project card when a new user signs up:\nimport { Github } from \"@trigger.dev/github\"; const github = new Github({ id: \"github\", }); client.defineJob({ id: \"create-project-card\", name: \"Create Project Card\", version: \"1.0.0\", trigger: eventTrigger({ name: \"new.user\", }), integrations: { github, }, run: async (payload, io, ctx) => { await io.github.runTask( \"create-card\", async (client, task) => { // client is an authenticated GitHub client (https://github.com/octokit/octokit.js) return client.rest.projects.createCard({ column_id: process.env.GITHUB_PROJECT_COLUMN_ID, note: `New User ${payload.user.name} signed up!`, }); }, { name: \"Create card\" } ); }, }); \nUsing an Integration Task Wrapper Function\nOur Integration packages also expose a number of task wrapper functions. These are functions that wrap a common task for that integration. For example, the Slack integration exposes a postMessage() function:\nimport { Slack } from \"@trigger.dev/slack\"; const slack = new Slack({ id: \"slack\", }); client.defineJob({ id: \"send-welcome-message\", name: \"Send welcome message\", version: \"1.0.0\", trigger: eventTrigger({ name: \"new.user\", }), integrations: { slack, }, run: async (payload, io, ctx) => { await io.slack.postMessage(\"send-message\", { channel: process.env.SLACK_CHANNEL_ID, text: `New user ${payload.user.name} signed up!`, }); }, }); \nAll task wrapper functions take a cacheKey as the first argument, because they are Tasks under the hood. Think of them as a convenience wrapper around io.runTask().\nWe strive to document all of the task wrapper functions in our Integration packages. For example, checkout our GitHub integration task docs.\nSubtasks\nYou can break up a task into multiple subtasks. This is useful for breaking up a long-running task into smaller chunks, while consolidating the logging into a single task in the dashboard with children.\nconst response = await io.runTask(\"parent-task\", async (task) => { await io.runTask(\"child-1\", async () => { // do something }); await io.runTask(\"child-2\", async () => { // do something }); }); \nTask cacheKey’s are automatically scoped to the parent task. So for example, you can reuse a cacheKey inside a parent task and it will not conflict with another top-level task.\nconst response = await io.runTask(\"parent-task\", async (task) => { await io.runTask(\"child-1\", async () => { // do something }); await io.runTask(\"child-2\", async () => { // do something }); }); // This will not conflict with the child-1 task above const response = await io.runTask(\"child-1\", async (task) => { // do something }); \nSubtasks allow you to DRY up any repeating task code into a single function. For example, if you have a common task that sends a welcome email, you can extract that into a function:\nconst sendWelcomeEmail = async (cacheKey: string, io: IO, resend: Resend, userId: string) => { return await io.runTask(cacheKey, async () => { const user = await io.runTask(\"fetch-user\", async () => { return prisma.user.findUniqueOrThrow({ where: { id: userId }, select: { email: true, name: true }, }); }); await io.resend.sendEmail(\"📧\", { to: user.email, from: \"eric@trigger.dev\", subject: \"Welcome!\", html: welcomeEmail(user.name), }); }); }; client.defineJob({ id: \"new-user\", name: \"Run when a new user signs up\", version: \"1.0.0\", trigger: eventTrigger({ name: \"new.user\", schema: z.object({ userId: z.string(), }), }), integrations: { resend, }, run: async (payload, io, ctx) => { await sendWelcomeEmail(\"🫡\", io, io.resend, payload.userId); }, }); \nLimitations\nA single task has an upper-bound on it’s execution duration, which must be less than the serverless function execution timeout of your deployed platform.

  "markdown": "> Send an event and any Jobs that subscribe to that event will get triggered.\n\n## Name and Schemas\n\n### Name\n\nEvent triggers have a `name`. They will only get triggered when an event with that name are sent.\n\n### Schema\n\nEvent triggers take a [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) schema. This is used to validate the data that is sent with the event. If the data does not match the schema, the Job will not run.\n\nIt also means that inside your run function the payload will be typed correctly. We use [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod#installation) for our schemas – it’s a fantastic library that allows you to define schemas in a very simple way.\n\nYou can always start out by using `z.any()` as your schema, and then later on you can add more strict validation. See our [Zod guide](https://trigger.dev/docs/documentation/guides/zod) for more information.\n\n## Example\n\n```\nclient.defineJob({\n  id: \"new-user-slack\",\n  name: \"New user slack message\",\n  version: \"0.1.0\",\n  trigger: eventTrigger({\n    name: \"user.created\",\n    schema: z.object({\n      name: z.string(),\n      email: z.string(),\n      paidPlan: z.boolean(),\n    }),\n    filter: {\n      //only run the Job if the user is paying\n      paidPlan: [true],\n    },\n  }),\n  integrations: {\n    slack,\n  },\n  //this function is run when the custom event is received\n  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {\n    //send a message to the #new-users Slack channel with user details\n    const response = await io.slack.postMessage(\"send-to-slack\", {\n      channel: \"CUKJXJZ3Z\",\n      text: `New user: ${payload.name} (${payload.email}) signed up. ${\n        payload.paidPlan ? \"They are paying\" : \"They are on the free plan\"\n      }.`,\n    });\n\n    return response.message;\n  },\n});\n```\n\n## Sending events\n\nThere are two ways of sending an event that will Trigger a Job.\n\n### 1\\.

You can add a negative-lookahead pattern to the matcher to exclude the `/api/trigger` route:\n\n```\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: [\"/((?!.*\\\\..*|_next).*)\", \"/\", \"/(api((?!/trigger))|trpc)(.*)\"],\n};\n```\n\nThe above will match anything starting with `/api` except for `/api/trigger`.\n\nIf you want to match all routes except for `/api/trigger`, you can use the following matcher:\n\n```\n// Match all routes other than /api/trigger\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: [\"/((?!api/trigger).*)\"],\n};\n```\n\nFor more information about middleware matchers, head over to the Next.js [middleware documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/middleware#matcher).\n\n### Clerk.com Auth Middleware\n\nIf you are using [Clerk.com](https://clerk.com/) for your Next.js authentication, make sure to update your middleware file to add `/api/trigger` to the `publicRoutes`, like so:\n\n```\nimport { authMiddleware } from \"@clerk/nextjs\";\n\n// Adding the /api/trigger route to the public routes so clerk doesn't return a 401\n// /api/trigger will handle it's own authentication\nexport default authMiddleware({\n  publicRoutes: [\"/api/trigger\"],\n});\n\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: [\"/((?!.*\\\\..*|_next).*)\", \"/\", \"/(api|trpc)(.*)\"],\n};\n```\n\n### Known issues\n\n*   `Module parse failed: Identifier 'NextResponse' has already been declared .` This error is caused by version 13.4.4. For further information, please [visit](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/issues/7660)"

You can choose one of the following package managers:\n\n  \n\n## Obtaining the Development API Key\n\nTo locate your development API key, login to the [Trigger.dev dashboard](https://cloud.trigger.dev/) and select the Project you want to connect to. Then click on the Environments & API Keys tab in the left menu. You can copy your development API Key from the field at the top of this page. (Your development key will start with `tr_dev_`).\n\n## Adding Environment Variables\n\nCreate a `.env` file at the root of your project and include your Trigger API key and URL like this:\n\n```\nTRIGGER_API_KEY=ENTER_YOUR_DEVELOPMENT_API_KEY_HERE\nTRIGGER_API_URL=https://api.trigger.dev # this is only necessary if you are self-hosting\n```\n\nReplace `ENTER_YOUR_DEVELOPMENT_API_KEY_HERE` with the actual API key obtained from the previous step.\n\n## Syncing Environment Variable types (TypeScript)\n\nYou will have type errors for your environment variables unless you run this command:\n\n## Configuring the Trigger Client\n\nCreate a file at `<root>/src/trigger.ts` or `<root>/trigger.ts` depending on whether you're using the `src` directory or not. `<root>` represents the root directory of your project.\n\nNext, add the following code to the file which creates and exports a new `TriggerClient`:\n\n```\n// trigger.ts (for TypeScript) or trigger.js (for JavaScript)\n\nimport { TriggerClient } from \"@trigger.dev/sdk\";\nimport { TRIGGER_API_KEY, TRIGGER_API_URL } from \"$env/static/private\";\n\nexport const client = new TriggerClient({\n  id: \"my-app\",\n  apiKey: TRIGGER_API_KEY,\n  apiUrl: TRIGGER_API_URL,\n});\n```\n\nReplace **\"my-app\"** with an appropriate identifier for your project.\n\n## Creating the API Route\n\nTo establish an API route for interacting with Trigger.dev, follow these steps based on your project's file type and structure\n\nCreate a new file named `+server.(ts/js)` within the `src/routes/api/trigger` directory, and add the following code:\n\n```\nimport { createSvelteRoute } from \"@trigger.dev/sveltekit\";\nimport { client } from \"../../../trigger\";\n\n//import all jobs\nimport \"../../../jobs\";\n\n// Create the Svelte route handler using the createSvelteRoute function\nconst svelteRoute = createSvelteRoute(client);\n\n// Define your API route handler\nexport const POST = svelteRoute.POST;\n```\n\n## Creating the Example Job\n\n1.  Create a folder named `jobs` alongside your `src` directory\n2.  Inside the `jobs` folder, add two files named `example.(ts/js)` and `index.(ts/js)`.\n\n## Additonal Job Definitions\n\nYou can define more job definitions by creating additional files in the `jobs` folder and exporting them in the `src/jobs/index` file.\n\nFor example, in `index.(ts/js)`, you can export other job files like this:\n\n```\n// export all your job files here\nexport * from \"./example\";\nexport * from \"./other-job-file\";\n```\n\n## Adding Configuration to `package.json`\n\nInside the `package.json` file, add the following configuration under the root object:\n\n```\n\"trigger.dev\": {\n  \"endpointId\": \"my-app\"\n}\n```\n\nYour `package.json` file might look something like this:\n\n```\n{\n  \"name\": \"my-app\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    // ... other dependencies\n  },\n  \"trigger.dev\": {\n    \"endpointId\": \"my-app\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nReplace **\"my-app\"** with the appropriate identifier you used during the step for creating the Trigger Client.\n\n## Running\n\n### Run your Sveltekit app\n\nRun your Sveltekit app locally. You need to use the `--host` flag to allow the Trigger.dev CLI to connect to your app.\n\nFor example:\n\n### Run the CLI 'dev' command\n\nIn a _**separate terminal window or tab**_ run:"

  "text": "Integrations allow you to quickly use APIs, including webhooks and Tasks.\nAuthentication\nThere are two ways to authenticate Integrations, OAuth and API Keys/Access Tokens.\nUsing for Jobs & Tasks\nYou must pass Integrations into your Job to run integration tasks. Passed in Integrations will be available on the io object in the run() function with the same name as the key. For example:\nclient.defineJob({ //... other options integrations: { slack, gh: github, }, run: async (payload, io, ctx) => { //slack is available on io.slack io.slack.postMessage(...); //github is available on io.gh io.gh.addIssueLabels(...); } }); \nBoth the postMessage and addIssueLabels functions above are implemented as an “Authenticated Task” that is defined inside the Integration, where the first argument is always the task key and the second argument is the parameters for the task. For example, here is how you would call the postMessage function above:\nclient.defineJob({ // ... integrations: { slack, }, run: async (payload, io, ctx) => { const response = await io.slack.postMessage(\"✋\", { channel: \"C04GWUTDC3W\", text: \"My first Slack message\", }); }, }); \nThe above code will create a Task that will use the authentication configured for the specified Slack integration.\nIf the integration does not support a specific task function that you want to use, you can use the runTask function to get access to the authenticated client.\nFor example, the Slack integration doesn’t expose an Authenticated Task function for deleting a message, but you can use the chat.delete function provided by the @slack/web-api package directly:\nclient.defineJob({ // ... integrations: { slack, }, run: async (payload, io, ctx) => { const response = await io.slack.postMessage(\"✋\", { channel: \"C04GWUTDC3W\", text: \"My first Slack message\", }); await io.wait(\"⏰\", 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000); // wait 24 hours await io.slack.runTask(\"delete\", async (slack) => { return slack.chat.delete({ channel: \"C04GWUTDC3W\", ts: response.ts!, }); }); }, }); \nYou can optionally pass a third parameter to runTask to specify the task parameters:\nawait io.slack.runTask( \"delete\", async (slack) => { return slack.chat.delete({ channel: \"C04GWUTDC3W\", ts: response.ts!, }); }, { name: \"Delete message\", properties: [{ label: \"Message\", text: response.ts }], } ); \nView the runTask reference for more information.\nUsing outside of Jobs\nIf you want to use integrations that support “local auth” only (e.g. API keys, like Stripe and Supabase) outside of a Job you can use the .native property on the integration to get direct access to the client. For example:\nimport { Stripe } from \"@trigger.dev/stripe\"; const stripe = new Stripe({ id: \"stripe\", apiKey: process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY!, }); async function createCustomer() { await stripe.native.customers.create({ // ... customer attributes go here }); } \nUsing for Triggers\nSome integrations provide triggers that you can use to start a Job. For example, the GitHub integration provides a push trigger that will start a Job when a new commit is pushed to a repository:\nimport { Github, events } from \"@trigger.dev/github\"; const github = new Github({ id: \"github\", token: process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN!, }); client.defineJob({ id: \"github-integration-on-push\", name: \"GitHub Integration - On Push\", version: \"0.1.0\", trigger: github.triggers.repo({ event: events.onPush, owner: \"triggerdotdev\", repo: \"trigger.dev\", }), run: async (payload, io, ctx) => { // do something on push }, }); \nBehind the scenes, our @trigger.dev/github integration will create a webhook on your repository that will call our API when a new push event is received. We will then start your Job with the payload from the push event.",

The below app will cost about $30/month.\n\n```\nfly deploy --vm-size performance-1x\n```\n\n## Visit and create an account\n\nOnce deployed, you should be able to open `https://<your fly app name>.fly.dev/` in your browser and create an account, either using GitHub or a magic email link.\n\n## Initialize your Next.js project\n\nNext you can easily bootstrap your Next.js project to use your self-hosted instance of Trigger.dev.\n\nFirst, `cd` into your Next.js project, then run the `@trigger.dev/cli init` command to initialize your Next.js project:\n\n```\nnpx @trigger.dev/cli@latest init -t \"https://<your fly app name>.fly.dev\"\n```\n\nWhen it asks for your development API key, head over to your self-hosted Trigger.dev dashboard and select the initial project you created when signing up, and head to the `Environments & API Keys` page to copy your `dev` API key:\n\n![api key](https://mintlify.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/trigger/images/api-key.png)\n\n## Start your dev server\n\nRun your Next.js project dev server with `npm run dev` and then in a new terminal window you will need to run the `@trigger.dev/cli dev` command to connect to your Trigger.dev instance and allow it to tunnel to your local Next.js server:\n\n```\nnpx @trigger.dev/cli@latest dev\n```\n\nAt this point you should be able to navigate to your Trigger.dev dashboard and view your registered jobs"

  "text": "Sometimes it makes sense to be able to invoke a Job manually, without having to specify an event, especially for cases where you want to get notified when the invoked Job Run is complete.\nTo specify that a job is manually invokable, you can use the invokeTrigger() function when defining a job:\nimport { invokeTrigger } from \"@trigger.dev/sdk\"; import { client } from \"@/trigger\"; export const exampleJob = client.defineJob({ id: \"example-job\", name: \"Example job\", version: \"1.0.1\", trigger: invokeTrigger(), run: async (payload, io, ctx) => { // do something with the payload }, }); \nAnd then you can invoke the job using the Job.invoke() method:\nimport { exampleJob } from \"./exampleJob\"; const jobRun = await exampleJob.invoke({ foo: \"bar\" }); \nPayload Schema\nYou can specify the type of the expected payload by passing a Zod schema to invokeTrigger():\nimport { invokeTrigger } from \"@trigger.dev/sdk\"; import { client } from \"@/trigger\"; export const exampleJob = client.defineJob({ id: \"example-job\", name: \"Example job\", version: \"1.0.1\", trigger: invokeTrigger({ //the expected payload shape schema: z.object({ userId: z.string(), tier: z.enum([\"free\", \"pro\"]), }), }), run: async (payload, io, ctx) => { // payload is typed as { userId: string, tier: \"free\" | \"pro\" } }, }); \nNow when you invoke the job, you will get a type error if the payload does not match the schema:\nimport { exampleJob } from \"./exampleJob\"; // this will throw a type error because the payload does not match the schema const jobRun = await exampleJob.invoke({ foo: \"bar\" }); // this will work const jobRun = await exampleJob.invoke({ userId: \"123\", tier: \"free\" }); \nInvoking a Job\nAs you can see in the example above, invoking a job is as simple as calling the Job.invoke() method. This method returns a JobRun object that you can use to track the progress of the job run, especially in conjunction with our React hooks, like useRunDetails()\nimport { exampleJob } from \"./exampleJob\"; // Somewhere in your backend code const jobRun = await exampleJob.invoke({ userId: \"123\", tier: \"free\" }); // Somewhere in your frontend code const { data: jobRunDetails } = useRunDetails(jobRun.id); \nDeduplicate Invocations\nYou can pass an optional idempotencyKey to the invoke() method to deduplicate invocations. This is useful when you want to make sure that a job is only invoked once for a given payload.\nimport { exampleJob } from \"./exampleJob\"; // Somewhere in your backend code const jobRun = await exampleJob.invoke( { userId: \"123\", tier: \"free\" }, { idempotencyKey: \"abc123\" } ); // This will not invoke the job again, but return the existing job run const jobRun2 = await exampleJob.invoke( { userId: \"123\", tier: \"free\" }, { idempotencyKey: \"abc123\" } ); \nCallback URL\nYou can also pass an optional callbackUrl to the invoke() method to get notified when the job run is complete, either successfully or with an error.\nimport { exampleJob } from \"./exampleJob\"; // Somewhere in your backend code const jobRun = await exampleJob.invoke( { userId: \"123\", tier: \"free\" }, { callbackUrl: `${process.env.VERCEL_URL}/api/trigger/runs` } ); \nWhen the run is complete, we will issue a POST request to the URL with the RunNotification payload.\nVerifying the callback\nYou should make sure to verify the payload in your callback route to make sure that the request is coming from Trigger. You can do this by checking the X-Trigger-Signature-256 header, which contains a HMAC signature of the payload using your secret API Key.\nimport { crypto } from \"node:crypto\" app.post(\"/api/trigger/runs\", (req, res) => { // Create digest with payload + hmac secret const hashPayload = req.rawBody; const hmac = crypto.createHmac(\"sha256\", process.env.TRIGGER_API_KEY); / const digest = Buffer.from( signatureAlgorithm + \"=\" + hmac.update(hashPayload).digest(\"hex\"), \"utf8\" ); // Get hash sent by the provider const providerSig = Buffer.from(req.get(\"X-Trigger-Signature-256\") || \"\", \"utf8\"); // Compare digest signature with signature sent by provider if (providerSig.length !== digest.length || !crypto.timingSafeEqual(digest, providerSig)) { res.status(401).send(\"Unauthorized\"); } else { // Webhook Authenticated // process and respond... res.json({ message: \"Success\" }); } }); \nAdditional context\nYou can pass an optional context object to the invoke() method, which will be available in the job run context. This is useful for passing additional information to the job run that doesn’t make sense in the payload.\nimport { exampleJob } from \"./exampleJob\"; // Somewhere in your backend code const jobRun = await exampleJob.invoke( { userId: \"123\", tier: \"free\" }, { context: { traceId: \"trace_123\", correlationId: \"def456\", }, } ); \nAnd then you can access the context in the job run:\nexport const exampleJob = client.defineJob({ id: \"example-job\", name: \"Example job\", version: \"1.0.1\", trigger: invokeTrigger({ //the expected payload shape schema: z.object({ userId: z.string(), tier: z.enum([\"free\", \"pro\"]), }), }), run: async (payload, io, ctx) => { console.log(ctx.event.context); // { traceId: \"trace_123\", correlationId: \"def456\" } }, }); \nInvoking a job from a job\nYou can also invoke a job from another job:\nimport { exampleJob } from \"./exampleJob\"; client.defineJob({ id: \"example-job2\", name: \"Example job 2\", version: \"1.0.1\", trigger: intervalTrigger({ seconds: 60, }), run: async (payload, io, ctx) => { const jobRun = await exampleJob.invoke(\"⚡\", { userId: \"123\", tier: \"free\" }); }, }); \nNotice how the invoke() method takes a string as the first argument. This is because under the hood invoke() is automatically creating a Task and the \"⚡\" string is the cacheKey for the created task. You can easily see the run created via the Run Dashboard:\nWait for completion\nYou can also invoke a job and wait for it to complete before continuing execution of the current job:\nimport { exampleJob } from \"./exampleJob\"; client.defineJob({ id: \"example-job2\", name: \"Example job 2\", version: \"1.0.1\", trigger: intervalTrigger({ seconds: 60, }), run: async (payload, io, ctx) => { const jobRun = await exampleJob.invokeAndWaitForCompletion(\"⚡\", { userId: \"123\", tier: \"free\", }); if (jobRun.ok) { // The job run finished successfully console.log(jobRun.output); } else { // The job run finished with an error console.log(`The job failed with status ${jobRun.status}`, jobRun.error); } }, }); \nBy default, invokeAndWaitForCompletion() will wait for the job run to complete for up to 60 minutes. You can change this by passing a timeoutInSeconds option:\nimport { exampleJob } from \"./exampleJob\"; client.defineJob({ id: \"example-job2\", name: \"Example job 2\", version: \"1.0.1\", trigger: intervalTrigger({ seconds: 60, }), run: async (payload, io, ctx) => { const jobRun = await exampleJob.invokeAndWaitForCompletion( \"⚡\", { userId: \"123\", tier: \"free\", }, 86_400 // 24 hours ); if (jobRun.ok) { // The job run finished successfully console.log(jobRun.output); } else { // The job run finished with an error console.log(`The job failed with status ${jobRun.status}`, jobRun.error); } }, }); \nThe return value of invokeAndWaitForCompletion is a RunNotification object.\nBatch invoke and wait for completion\nYou can also batch invoke jobs and wait for them all to complete before continuing execution of the current job:\nimport { exampleJob } from \"./exampleJob\"; client.defineJob({ id: \"example-job2\", name: \"Example job 2\", version: \"1.0.1\", trigger: intervalTrigger({ seconds: 60, }), run: async (payload, io, ctx) => { const runs = await exampleJob.batchInvokeAndWaitForCompletion(\"⚡\", [ { payload: { userId: \"123\", tier: \"free\", }, timeoutInSeconds: 86_400, // 24 hours }, { payload: { userId: \"abc\", tier: \"paid\", }, timeoutInSeconds: 86_400, // 24 hours }, ]); // runs is an array of RunNotification objects }, }); \nYou can batch up to 25 invocations at once, and we will run them in parallel and wait for all of them to complete before continuing execution of the current job.\nYou can in an optional options object to each invocation, if you want to pass context and accountId to each invocation:\nimport { exampleJob } from \"./exampleJob\"; client.defineJob({ id: \"example-job2\", name: \"Example job 2\", version: \"1.0.1\", trigger: intervalTrigger({ seconds: 60, }), run: async (payload, io, ctx) => { const runs = await exampleJob.batchInvokeAndWaitForCompletion(\"⚡\", [ { payload: { userId: \"123\", tier: \"free\", }, timeoutInSeconds: 86_400, // 24 hours options: { context: { traceId: \"trace_123\", correlationId: \"def456\", }, accountId: \"abc123\", }, }, { payload: { userId: \"abc\", tier: \"paid\", }, timeoutInSeconds: 86_400, // 24 hours options: { context: { traceId: \"trace_abc\", correlationId: \"defabc\", }, accountId: \"abc123\", }, }, ]); // runs is an array of RunNotification objects }, });",

(Your development key will start with `tr_dev_`).\n\n## Adding Environment Variables\n\nCreate a `.env` file at the root of your project and include your Trigger API key and URL like this:\n\n```\nTRIGGER_API_KEY=ENTER_YOUR_DEVELOPMENT_API_KEY_HERE\nTRIGGER_API_URL=https://api.trigger.dev # this is only necessary if you are self-hosting\n```\n\nReplace `ENTER_YOUR_DEVELOPMENT_API_KEY_HERE` with the actual API key obtained from the previous step.\n\n## Configuring the Trigger Client\n\nCreate a file for your Trigger client, in this case we create it at `<root>/trigger.(ts/js)`\n\n```\nimport { TriggerClient } from \"@trigger.dev/sdk\";\n\nexport const client = new TriggerClient({\n  id: \"my-app\",\n  apiKey: process.env.TRIGGER_API_KEY!,\n  apiUrl: process.env.TRIGGER_API_URL!,\n});\n```\n\nReplace **\"my-app\"** with an appropriate identifier for your project.\n\n## Adding the API endpoint\n\nThere are a few different options depending on how your Express project is configured.\n\n*   App middleware\n*   Entire app for Trigger.dev (only relevant if it's the only thing your project is for)\n\nSelect the appropriate code example from below:\n\n## Creating the Example Job\n\nCreate a Job file. In this case created `<root>/jobs/example.(ts/js)`\n\n```\nimport { eventTrigger } from \"@trigger.dev/sdk\";\nimport { client } from \"../trigger\";\n\n// your first job\nclient.defineJob({\n  id: \"example-job\",\n  name: \"Example Job\",\n  version: \"0.0.1\",\n  trigger: eventTrigger({\n    name: \"example.event\",\n  }),\n  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {\n    await io.logger.info(\"Hello world!\", { payload });\n\n    return {\n      message: \"Hello world!\",\n    };\n  },\n});\n```\n\n## Adding Configuration to `package.json`\n\nInside the `package.json` file, add the following configuration under the root object:\n\n```\n\"trigger.dev\": {\n  \"endpointId\": \"my-app\"\n}\n\n```\n\nReplace **\"my-app\"** with the appropriate identifier you used in the trigger.js configuration file.\n\n## Running\n\n### Run your Express app\n\nRun your Express app locally, like you normally would. For example:\n\n### Run the CLI 'dev' command\n\nIn a _**separate terminal window or tab**_ run:"

  "text": "In the previous guides we’ve covered how you can use our integrations with API Keys or OAuth, but in both cases those authentication credentials belong to you the developer.\nIf you want to use our integrations using auth credentials of your users you can use an Auth Resolver which allows you to implement your own custom auth resolving using a third-party service like Clerk or Nango\nIn this guide we’ll demonstrate how to use Clerk.com’s Social Connections to allow you to make requests with your user’s Slack credentials and the official Trigger.dev Slack integration\n1. Install the Slack integration package\n2. Create a Slack integration\nimport { Slack } from \"@trigger.dev/slack\"; const byoSlack = new Slack({ id: \"byo-slack\", }); \n3. Define an Auth Resolver\nUsing your TriggerClient instance, define a new Auth Resolver for the slack integration:\nimport { Slack } from \"@trigger.dev/slack\"; // Import your TriggerClient instance. This is merely an example of how you could do it import { client } from \"./trigger\"; const byoSlack = new Slack({ id: \"byo-slack\", }); client.defineAuthResolver(byoSlack, async (ctx) => { // this is where we'll use the clerk backend SDK }); \n4. Define a job\nBefore we finish the Slack Auth Resolver, let’s create an example job that uses the Slack integration:\nimport { z } from \"zod\"; client.defineJob({ id: \"post-a-message\", name: \"Post a Slack Message\", version: \"1.0.0\", trigger: eventTrigger({ name: \"post.message\", schema: z.object({ text: z.string(), channel: z.string(), }), }), integrations: { slack: byoSlack, }, run: async (payload, io, ctx) => { await io.slack.postMessage(\"💬\", { channel: payload.channel, text: payload.text, }); }, }); \nAs you can see above, we’re passing the byoSlack integration into the Job and using it by calling io.slack.postMessage.\n5. Install the Clerk backend SDK\n6. Import and initialize the Clerk SDK\nimport { Clerk } from \"@clerk/backend\"; // Clerk is not a class so the omission of `new Clerk` here is on purpose const clerk = Clerk({ apiKey: process.env.CLERK_API_KEY }); \n7. Implement the Auth Resolver\nNow we’ll implement the Auth Resolver to provide authentication credentials saved in Clerk.com for Job runs, depending on the account ID of the run.\nclient.defineAuthResolver(slack, async (ctx) => { if (!ctx.account?.id) { return; } const tokens = await clerk.users.getUserOauthAccessToken(ctx.account.id, \"oauth_slack\"); if (tokens.length === 0) { throw new Error(`Could not find Slack auth for account ${ctx.account.id}`); } return { type: \"oauth\", token: tokens[0].token, }; }); \nThe first parameter to the Auth Resolver callback is the run context (reference docs), which optionally contains an associated account (more on this below).\nBonus: Multiple Slack integration clients\nIf you want to also use Slack with your own authentication credentials, you can always create another slack integration with a different id.\nconst ourSlack = new Slack({ id: \"our-slack\" }); client.defineJob({ id: \"post-a-message\", name: \"Post a Slack Message\", version: \"1.0.0\", trigger: eventTrigger({ name: \"post.message\", schema: z.object({ text: z.string(), channel: z.string(), }), }), integrations: { byoSlack: byoSlack, ourSlack: ourSlack, }, run: async (payload, io, ctx) => { await io.byoSlack.postMessage(\"💬\", { channel: payload.channel, text: payload.text, }); await io.ourSlack.postMessage(\"📢\", { channel: \"C01234567\", text: `We just sent the following message to ${ctx.account?.id}: ${payload.text}`, }); }, }); \nHow to Trigger Job runs with an Account ID\nNow that we have a working Clerk.com Auth Resolver for Slack we’re ready to start triggering jobs with an associated account ID. The way you do this is different depending on the Trigger type.\nEvent Triggers\nJobs that have Event Triggers can be run with an associated account by providing an accountId when calling sendEvent:\n// This is an instance of `TriggerClient` await client.sendEvent( { name: \"post.created\", payload: { id: \"post_123\" }, }, { accountId: \"user_123\", } ); \nThe accountId value is completely arbitrary and doesn’t map to anything inside Trigger.dev, but generally it should be a unique ID that can be used to lookup Auth credentials in your Auth Resolvers.\nYou can also send events with an associated account ID from the run of another job:\nclient.defineJob({ id: \"event-1\", name: \"Run when the foo.bar event happens\", version: \"0.0.1\", trigger: eventTrigger({ name: \"foo.bar\", }), run: async (payload, io, ctx) => { //send an event using `io` await io.sendEvent( \"🎫\", { name: \"post.created\", payload: { id: \"post_123\" }, }, { accountId: \"user_123\", } ); }, }); \nWhen a run is triggered with an associated account ID, you’ll see the account ID in the run dashboard:\nScheduled Triggers\nRunning a job with an associated account ID that is triggered by a Scheduled Trigger works a bit differently than Event Triggers as you’ll need to convert your normal intervalTrigger or cronTrigger into using a Dynamic Schedule and then registering schedules with an associated account ID.\n1. Convert a job to using a Dynamic Schedule\nFirst let’s convert the following job from an intervalTrigger to a Dynamic Schedule:\n// Before client.defineJob({ id: \"scheduled-job\", name: \"Scheduled Job\", version: \"1.0.0\", trigger: intervalTrigger({ seconds: 60, }), run: async (payload, io, ctx) => { await io.logger.info(\"This runs every 60 seconds\"); }, }); // After export const dynamicInterval = client.defineDynamicSchedule({ id: \"my-schedule\" }); client.defineJob({ id: \"scheduled-job\", name: \"Scheduled Job\", version: \"1.0.0\", trigger: dynamicInterval, run: async (payload, io, ctx) => { await io.logger.info(\"This runs dynamic schedules\"); }, }); \nAs you can see above, we’ve dropped the specific interval when defining the trigger as that will now be specific when registering schedules.\n2. Register a schedule\nYou can now use the dynamicInterval instance to register a schedule, which will trigger the scheduled-job:\nimport { dynamicInterval } from \"./dynamicSchedule\"; // Somewhere in your backend await dynamicInterval.register(\"schedule_123\", { type: \"interval\", options: { seconds: 60 }, accountId: \"user_123\", // associate runs triggered by this schedule with user_123 }); \nAs you can see above, we’ve associated this registered schedule with an accountId, so any runs triggered by this schedule will be associated with \"user_123\"\nThe first parameter above \"schedule_123\" is the Schedule ID and can be used to unregister the schedule at a later point:\nimport { dynamicInterval } from \"./dynamicSchedule\"; // Somewhere in your backend await dynamicInterval.unregister(\"schedule_123\"); \nYou can also use register/unregister inside another job run and it will automatically create a Task:\nimport { dynamicInterval } from \"./dynamicSchedule\"; client.defineJob({ id: \"event-1\", name: \"Run when the foo.bar event happens\", version: \"0.0.1\", trigger: eventTrigger({ name: \"foo.bar\", }), run: async (payload, io, ctx) => { await dynamicInterval.register(\"schedule_123\", { type: \"interval\", options: { seconds: 60 }, accountId: \"user_123\", // associate runs triggered by this schedule with user_123 }); }, }); \nWill produce the following run dashboard:\nWebhook Triggers\nRunning a job with an associated account ID that is triggered by a Webhook Trigger requires converting to the use of a Dynamic Trigger\nDynamic Trigger’s work very similarly to Dynamic Schedules, but instead of registering schedules, you register triggers:\nTesting jobs with Account ID\nIf a job uses any integrations with an Auth Resolver that requires an account ID, you’ll need to provide an account ID when testing the job:\nAuth Resolver reference\nThe Auth Resolver callback has the following signature:\ntype TriggerAuthResolver = ( ctx: TriggerContext, integration: TriggerIntegration ) => Promise<AuthResolverResult | undefined>; type AuthResolverResult = { type: \"apiKey\" | \"oauth\"; token: string; additionalFields?: Record<string, string>; }; \nThe ctx parameter is the TriggerContext for the run and the integration parameter is the TriggerIntegration instance that the Auth Resolver is being called for. You can use the integration parameter to check the id of the integration to determine which integration the Auth Resolver is being called for:\nclient.defineAuthResolver(slack, async (ctx, integration) => { if (integration.id === \"byo-slack\") { // do something } }); \nYou can also return additionalFields in the Auth Resolver result which will be passed to the integration when making requests. This is useful if you need to provide additional fields to the integration that are not part of the standard integration options.\nclient.defineAuthResolver(shopify, async (ctx, integration) => { return { type: \"apiKey\", token: \"my-api-key\", additionalFields: { shop: \"my-shop-name\", }, }; });",

Then click on the Environments & API Keys tab in the left menu. You can copy your development Server API Key from the field at the top of this page. (Your development key will start with tr_dev_).\nConfigure Environment Variables\nAdd the following environment variables to your .env file (or .dev.vars file if you are using Cloudflare Workers):\nTRIGGER_API_KEY=<development server api key> TRIGGER_API_URL=https://api.trigger.dev # change this if you are self-hosting \nReplace <development server api key> with the actual API key obtained from the previous step.\nEnable Node.js compatibility\nIf you are using Cloudflare Workers, you’ll need to enable Node.js compatibility mode in your wrangler.toml file:\ncompatibility_flags = [\"nodejs_compat\"] \nAdd Middelware to Your Hono app\nOur @trigger.dev/hono package provides two different ways of configuring the necessary middleware needed to connect your Hono app to Trigger.dev. addMiddleware which should be used for Cloudflare Workers, and createMiddleware which can be used with Bun, Deno, and Node.js.\nCloudflare Workers\nBecause environment variables in Cloudflare Workers aren’t available in the global scope, but are instead available only inside the fetch handler, we need to use the addMiddleware function to add the necessary middleware to your Hono app.\nimport { Hono } from \"hono\"; import { addMiddleware } from \"@trigger.dev/hono\"; import { TriggerClient } from \"@trigger.dev/sdk\"; const app = new Hono<{ Bindings: { TRIGGER_API_KEY: string; TRIGGER_API_URL: string; }; }>(); addMiddleware(app, (env) => { const client = new TriggerClient({ id: \"hono-client\", apiKey: env.TRIGGER_API_KEY, apiUrl: env.TRIGGER_API_URL, }); return client; }); // Your other routes here export default app; \nThe second argument to addMiddleware is a function that receives the environment variables (either from .dev.vars in development or from Cloudflare when deployed), and returns a TriggerClient instance. This function will be called once per request.\nIf you want, you can extract our the function that creates the TriggerClient instance into a separate file, and import it into your index.ts file:\nNow that you’ve created the TriggerClient and setup the middleware, you can add your first job:\nAs you can see above in jobs.ts, we define our first job using the new Job constructor from @trigger.dev/sdk, and then in trigger-client.ts we attach the job to the TriggerClient instance.\nBun\nIf you are using Bun, you can use the createMiddleware function to create the necessary middleware to connect your Hono app to Trigger.dev and define your TriggerClient and jobs in the global scope:\nimport { createMiddleware } from \"@trigger.dev/hono\"; import { TriggerClient, invokeTrigger } from \"@trigger.dev/sdk\"; import { Hono } from \"hono\"; const app = new Hono(); const client = new TriggerClient({ id: \"hono-client\", apiKey: Bun.env.TRIGGER_API_KEY, // Bun.env is available in the global scope apiUrl: Bun.env.TRIGGER_API_URL, // Bun.env is available in the global scope }); client.defineJob({ id: \"example-job\", name: \"Example Job\", version: \"0.0.1\", trigger: invokeTrigger(), run: async (payload, io, ctx) => { await io.logger.info(\"Hello world!\", { payload }); return { message: \"Hello world!\", }; }, }); app.use(\"/api/trigger\", createMiddleware(client)); // The rest of your routes here export default app; \nDeno\nImport trigger.dev packages with Deno using npm: specifiers:\nimport { createMiddleware } from \"npm:@trigger.dev/hono@latest\"; import { TriggerClient, invokeTrigger } from \"npm:@trigger.dev/sdk@latest\"; import { Hono } from \"npm:hono\"; // Make sure to use the npm specifier for hono as well \nTo load a .env file on startup, pass the deno run command a --env flag:\ndeno run --env --allow-net --watch index.ts \nYou can also load an environment variables file in code using the dotenv package:\nimport { load } from \"https://deno.land/std@0.208.0/dotenv/mod.ts\"; const env = await load(); \nIn which case you need to pass the --allow-env and --allow-read flags:\ndeno run --allow-env --allow-net --allow-read --watch index.ts \nNow we can create the TriggerClient, define our jobs, and create the middleware:\nconst app = new Hono(); const client = new TriggerClient({ id: \"hono-client\", apiKey: env[\"TRIGGER_API_KEY\"], apiUrl: env[\"TRIGGER_API_URL\"], }); client.defineJob({ id: \"example-job\", name: \"Example Job\", version: \"0.0.1\", trigger: invokeTrigger(), run: async (payload, io, ctx) => { await io.logger.info(\"Hello world!\", { payload }); return { message: \"Hello world!\", }; }, }); app.use(\"/api/trigger\", createMiddleware(client)); // The rest of your routes here Deno.serve(app.fetch); \nNode.js\nNode.js works very similarly to Deno and Bun, in that you can define the TriggerClient and jobs in the global scope, and then create the middleware and add it to your Hono app:\nimport \"dotenv/config\"; import { serve } from \"@hono/node-server\"; import { Hono } from \"hono\"; import { createMiddleware } from \"@trigger.dev/hono\"; import { TriggerClient, invokeTrigger } from \"@trigger.dev/sdk\"; const app = new Hono(); const client = new TriggerClient({ id: \"hono-client\", apiKey: process.env.TRIGGER_API_KEY!, apiUrl: process.env.TRIGGER_API_URL!, }); client.defineJob({ id: \"example-job\", name: \"Example Job\", version: \"0.0.1\", trigger: invokeTrigger(), run: async (payload, io, ctx) => { await io.logger.info(\"Hello world!\", { payload }); return { message: \"Hello world!\", }; }, }); app.use(\"/api/trigger\", createMiddleware(client)); // Your other routes here serve(app, (info) => { console.log(`Listening on port ${info.port}`); }); \nRunning\nCloudflare Workers\nRun your Hono app locally, like you normally would.

This function will be called once per request.\n\nIf you want, you can extract our the function that creates the `TriggerClient` instance into a separate file, and import it into your `index.ts` file:\n\nNow that you’ve created the `TriggerClient` and setup the middleware, you can add your first job:\n\nAs you can see above in `jobs.ts`, we define our first job using the `new Job` constructor from `@trigger.dev/sdk`, and then in `trigger-client.ts` we attach the job to the `TriggerClient` instance.\n\n### Bun\n\nIf you are using Bun, you can use the `createMiddleware` function to create the necessary middleware to connect your Hono app to Trigger.dev and define your `TriggerClient` and jobs in the global scope:\n\n```\nimport { createMiddleware } from \"@trigger.dev/hono\";\nimport { TriggerClient, invokeTrigger } from \"@trigger.dev/sdk\";\nimport { Hono } from \"hono\";\n\nconst app = new Hono();\n\nconst client = new TriggerClient({\n  id: \"hono-client\",\n  apiKey: Bun.env.TRIGGER_API_KEY, // Bun.env is available in the global scope\n  apiUrl: Bun.env.TRIGGER_API_URL, // Bun.env is available in the global scope\n});\n\nclient.defineJob({\n  id: \"example-job\",\n  name: \"Example Job\",\n  version: \"0.0.1\",\n  trigger: invokeTrigger(),\n  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {\n    await io.logger.info(\"Hello world!\", { payload });\n\n    return {\n      message: \"Hello world!\",\n    };\n  },\n});\n\napp.use(\"/api/trigger\", createMiddleware(client));\n\n// The rest of your routes here\n\nexport default app;\n```\n\n### Deno\n\nImport trigger.dev packages with Deno using [npm: specifiers](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/node/npm_specifiers):\n\n```\nimport { createMiddleware } from \"npm:@trigger.dev/hono@latest\";\nimport { TriggerClient, invokeTrigger } from \"npm:@trigger.dev/sdk@latest\";\nimport { Hono } from \"npm:hono\"; // Make sure to use the npm specifier for hono as well\n```\n\nTo load a `.env` file on startup, pass the `deno run` command a `--env` flag:\n\n```\ndeno run --env --allow-net --watch index.ts\n```\n\nYou can also load an environment variables file in code using the `dotenv` package:\n\n```\nimport { load } from \"https://deno.land/std@0.208.0/dotenv/mod.ts\";\nconst env = await load();\n```\n\nIn which case you need to pass the `--allow-env` and `--allow-read` flags:\n\n```\ndeno run --allow-env --allow-net --allow-read --watch index.ts\n```\n\nNow we can create the `TriggerClient`, define our jobs, and create the middleware:\n\n```\nconst app = new Hono();\n\nconst client = new TriggerClient({\n  id: \"hono-client\",\n  apiKey: env[\"TRIGGER_API_KEY\"],\n  apiUrl: env[\"TRIGGER_API_URL\"],\n});\n\nclient.defineJob({\n  id: \"example-job\",\n  name: \"Example Job\",\n  version: \"0.0.1\",\n  trigger: invokeTrigger(),\n  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {\n    await io.logger.info(\"Hello world!\", { payload });\n\n    return {\n      message: \"Hello world!\",\n    };\n  },\n});\n\napp.use(\"/api/trigger\", createMiddleware(client));\n\n// The rest of your routes here\n\nDeno.serve(app.fetch);\n```\n\n### Node.js\n\nNode.js works very similarly to Deno and Bun, in that you can define the `TriggerClient` and jobs in the global scope, and then create the middleware and add it to your Hono app:\n\n```\nimport \"dotenv/config\";\nimport { serve } from \"@hono/node-server\";\nimport { Hono } from \"hono\";\nimport { createMiddleware } from \"@trigger.dev/hono\";\nimport { TriggerClient, invokeTrigger } from \"@trigger.dev/sdk\";\n\nconst app = new Hono();\n\nconst client = new TriggerClient({\n  id: \"hono-client\",\n  apiKey: process.env.TRIGGER_API_KEY!,\n  apiUrl: process.env.TRIGGER_API_URL!,\n});\n\nclient.defineJob({\n  id: \"example-job\",\n  name: \"Example Job\",\n  version: \"0.0.1\",\n  trigger: invokeTrigger(),\n  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {\n    await io.logger.info(\"Hello world!\", { payload });\n\n    return {\n      message: \"Hello world!\",\n    };\n  },\n});\n\napp.use(\"/api/trigger\", createMiddleware(client));\n\n// Your other routes here\n\nserve(app, (info) => {\n  console.log(`Listening on port ${info.port}`);\n});\n```\n\n## Running\n\n### Cloudflare Workers\n\nRun your Hono app locally, like you normally would. For example:\n\nIn a _**separate terminal window or tab**_ run:\n\n### Bun\n\nRun your Hono app locally, like you normally would. For example:\n\nIn a _**separate terminal window or tab**_ run:\n\n### Deno\n\nRun your Hono app locally, like you normally would. For example:\n\n```\ndeno run --env --allow-net --watch index.ts\n```\n\nIn a _**separate terminal window or tab**_ run:\n\n### Node.js\n\nRun your Hono app locally, like you normally would. For example:\n\nIn a _**separate terminal window or tab**_ run:"
